Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.</p>\r\n<p>The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can take an action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Another creature can take an action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, provided the puller isn’t pulled inside the bag first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.</p>\r\n<p>Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.</p>\r\n<p>If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the [lore]Astral Plane[/lore].</p>",

The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy&mdash;not the spell itself&mdash; is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.</p>\r\n<p>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.</p>\r\n<p>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.</p>\r\n<p>A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.</p>",

If the arrow hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition for 1 minute. As an action, a creature Restrained by an arrow can make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to try to break the restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful check.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Arrow of Transport.</em></strong> As a Magic action, you can fire one energy arrow from this weapon at a target you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, provided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-foot Cube. The arrow teleports the target to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Energy Ladder.</em></strong> As a Magic action, you can loose a flurry of energy arrows from this weapon at a wall up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows become glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, forming a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall. This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A young dwarf prince set out to forge a weapon that would be regarded as a symbol of unity among his people. Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, a god of creation, he first crafted four mighty tools: the Starmetal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With these tools, he forged the <em>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Armed with the Artifact, the prince brought peace to the dwarf clans, ending grudges and answering slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.</p>\r\n<p>Later, in an era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Magic Weapon.</strong></em> The <em>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</em> is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.</p>\r\n<p>When you attack a creature with the axe and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the axe deals an extra 20 Slashing damage.</p>\r\n<p>The axe has the Thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is a creature of the Giant type. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Blessings of Moradin. </strong></em>While attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Fortitude of Stone.</strong></em> Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gifts of the Creator.</strong></em> You have proficiency with Brewer’s Supplies, Mason’s Tools, and Smith’s Tools.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>One with the Forge.</strong></em> You have Immunity to Poison damage and Resistance to Fire damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Sunder.</strong></em> When you hit an object with the axe, the object takes the maximum amount of damage possible.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Conjure Earth Elemental.</strong></em> While holding the axe, you can take a Magic action to summon an Earth Elemental. It appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 24 hours, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. You can’t use this property again until the next dawn.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The axe has the following random properties:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\r\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\r\n<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><strong>Travel the Depths.</strong></em> You can take a Magic action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast Teleport from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can’t use this property again until 3 days have passed.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Axe.</strong></em> The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for 50 years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.</p>",

Only a creature that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits.</p>\r\n<p>Other creatures that peruse the book’s open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. A Fiend, an Undead, or a servant of a god from the Lower Planes that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 Radiant damage. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity, and it can’t be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage disappears in a flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. The book then vanishes, and the creature’s Attunement to it ends.</p>\r\n<p>Benefits granted by the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Celestial Calm.</strong></em> While attuned to the book, you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions and Resistance to Psychic damage. These benefits become permanent after you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Divine Wisdom.</strong></em> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can’t gain this benefit from the book more than once.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Enlightened Magic.</strong></em> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Halo.</strong></em> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a Bonus Action. While present, the halo gives you Advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks. In addition, Fiends and Undead within the halo’s Bright Light make attack rolls against you with Disadvantage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> <em>The Book of Exalted Deeds</em> has the following random properties:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\r\n<li>2 major beneficial properties</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Book.</strong></em> <em>The Book of Exalted Deeds</em> can’t be destroyed. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The contents of this foul manuscript are the meat and drink of the wicked. It contains knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites doom.</p>\r\n<p>Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>. He recorded in its pages every horrid idea, every corrupt thought, and every example of foul magic he came across or devised.</p>\r\n<p>Other practitioners of evil have added their own input to the book’s catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn, or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can’t be divined.</p>\r\n<p>Nature can’t abide the book’s presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, common animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever a creature that isn’t a Fiend or an Undead attunes to the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>, that creature makes a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically transformed into a <strong>Larva</strong> under the DM’s control. Only a <em>Wish</em> spell can reverse this vile transformation.</p>\r\n<p>A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and use its Adjusted Ability Scores, Tireless Form, Spells, Vile Lore, and Vile Speech properties.</p>\r\n<p>The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears, your Attunement to it ends immediately, and you lose all benefits granted by it. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can’t be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Adjusted Ability Scores.</strong></em> One ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can’t adjust your ability scores again.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Tireless Form.</strong></em> While the book is on your person, you have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> has the following random properties:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>3 minor beneficial properties</li>\r\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\r\n<li>3 minor detrimental properties</li>\r\n<li>2 major detrimental properties</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While attuned to the book, you can cast the following spells (save DC 18) from it:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Animate Dead</li>\r\n<li>Circle of Death</li>\r\n<li>Dominate Monster</li>\r\n<li>Finger of Death</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you use the book to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Vile Lore.</strong></em> You can reference the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, you have Advantage on that check.</p>\r\n<p>At the DM’s discretion, the book might reveal secrets no mortal should know, such as the true names of powerful Fiends, foul rites that allow one to transform into a death knight or lich, or long-lost spells crafted by beings so evil their names ought never to be spoken aloud.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Vile Speech.</strong></em> While the book is on your person, you can take a Magic action to recite words from its pages in a foul, dead language. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 Psychic damage, and each creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 Psychic damage unless the creature is a Fiend or an Undead.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Book.</strong></em> The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.</p>\r\n<p>If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it re-forms in some far corner of the multiverse.</p>\r\n<p>A creature attuned to the book for 100 years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book re-forms 1d10 &times; 100 years later.</p>",

The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm.

The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Moon.</strong></em> You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Puzzle.</strong></em> Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rogue.</strong></em> An NPC of the DM’s choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don’t know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Ruin.</strong></em> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see the <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Sage.</strong></em> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Skull.</strong></em> An <strong>Avatar of Death</strong> appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another <strong>Avatar of Death</strong>. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks.

The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book’s spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Abyssal Lore.</em></strong> You can reference the <em>Demonomicon</em> whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you gain Advantage on the check.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Containment.</em></strong> The first ten pages of the <em>Demonomicon</em> are blank. As a Magic action while holding the book, you can target a Fiend that you can see that is trapped within the area of a Magic Circle spell. The Fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with Disadvantage or become trapped within one of the <em>Demonomicon</em>’s blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature’s widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>\r\n<p>When you finish a Long Rest, if you and the <em>Demonomicon</em> are on the same plane of existence, one trapped creature within the book can attempt to possess you. You make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. As a Magic action, the possessing creature can release you and appear in the closest unoccupied space to you. On a successful save, the Fiend can’t try to possess you again for 7 days (but another Fiend trapped in the book can certainly try).</p>\r\n<p>When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 Fiends occupying its pages&mdash;typically an assortment of demons.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Ensnarement.</em></strong> While carrying the book, whenever you cast Magic Circle naming only Fiends or cast Planar Binding targeting a Fiend, the spell is cast at level 9, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the Fiend has Disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Fiendish Scourging.</em></strong> While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a Fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The Artifact has the following random properties (see &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/treasure#Artifacts\">Artifacts</a>&rdquo; in the <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\r\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\r\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The book has 8 charges and regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the book, you can take a Magic action to cast one of the spells (save DC 20) on the following table. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.</p>\r\n<table class=\"table-compendium table--left-first\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Spell</th>\r\n<th>Charge Cost</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Magic Circle</td>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Magic Jar</td>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Planar Ally</td>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Planar Binding</td>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Plane Shift (to the [lore]Abyss[/lore] only)</td>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Summon Fiend</td>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Tasha’s Hideous Laughter</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Demonomicon.</em></strong> To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book’s pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book’s remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semisentient domain lies a long-lost Artifact, <em>Fraz-Urb’luu’s Staff</em>. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and out-of-date copy of the <em>Tome of Zyx</em>, the work that served as the foundation of the <em>Demonomicon of Iggwilv</em>. The <em>Tome of Zyx</em> can be destroyed like any ordinary book. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb’luu knows instantly.</p>",

You can cast a spell on the <em>Hand of Vecna</em> Spells table from the hand (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from it, the hand casts Suggestion on you (save DC 18; no Concentration required), demanding that you commit an evil act.

The target makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is transformed into <a href=\"https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox/#GreenSlime\">green slime</a> (see <a href=\"https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox\">chapter 3</a>) that covers the ground in its space, each 5-foot square of slime representing a separate patch.

Once used, this property can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Eye and Hand.</strong></em> If the <em>Eye of Vecna</em> and the <em>Hand of Vecna</em> are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed.

The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Taking Fire Damage.</strong></em> Roll 1d20 if you are wearing the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems and is then destroyed.

It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it.</p>\r\n<p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.</p>\r\n<p>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</p>\r\n<p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.</p>\r\n<p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate.</p>\r\n<p>In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.</p>\r\n<p>Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Of all the magic items created by elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a <em>Moonblade</em>. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such weapon. Over the centuries, some of these weapons have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Others have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.</p>\r\n<p>Every <em>Moonblade</em> longs for a bearer whose disposition and goals are compatible with its own. If you try to attune to a <em>Moonblade</em> that doesn’t want you as its bearer, the weapon not only rejects you but also places a curse on you, causing you to make D20 Tests with Disadvantage for 24 hours or until the curse is ended by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic. If you’re accepted by the weapon and try to attune to it, you become attuned to it instantly, and a new rune appears on it. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A <em>Moonblade</em> functions like a nonmagical weapon of its kind for anyone other than its chosen bearer.</p>\r\n<p>A <em>Moonblade</em> has one rune on it for each bearer it has willingly served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the <em>Moonblade</em> an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly by rolling on the Moonblade Properties table.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Minor Property.</strong></em> In addition to its aforementioned properties, each <em>Moonblade</em> has a minor property determined by rolling on the Magic Item’s Minor Property table.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> A <em>Moonblade</em> is a sentient weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet. Its alignment matches that of its creator.</p>\r\n<p>The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder’s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate through visions or dreams when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> A <em>Moonblade</em> has a personality similar to that of its creator. Once a <em>Moonblade</em> has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the bearer’s alignment differs from that of the weapon’s or the bearer’s goals later clash with the weapon’s goals.</p>\r\n<table class=\"table-compendium table--generic-dice\" style=\"--sb-table-row-bg-hover: #b3d3df; --sb-table-row-bg-dark: #d7e8ee; --sb-table-row-bg-light: #f1f7f9; --dark-sb-table-row-bg-light: #5e7982; --dark-sb-table-row-bg-dark: #5c7f8c; --dark-sb-table-row-bg-hover: #78a2b0;\"><caption>Moonblade Properties</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>1d100</th>\r\n<th>Property</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>01-60</td>\r\n<td>Increase the weapon’s bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3.

        "description": "<p>Long ago, in the Dragonlance setting, elves and humans waged a terrible war against chromatic dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and forged five <em>Orbs of Dragonkind</em> to help defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>\r\n<p>As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped over the centuries. Their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, but they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\r\n<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those who try to wield an orb’s magic but lack sufficient force of personality might find themselves under the orb’s control.</p>\r\n<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>\r\n<p>While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic action to peer into the orb’s depths. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>\r\n<p>While you are Charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the DM decides.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> <em>An Orb of Dragonkind</em> has the following <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure#ArtifactProperties\">random properties</a> (see the <a class=\"sourcebook\" href=\"https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\r\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\r\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.</p>\r\n<table class=\"table-compendium table--left-first\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Spell</th>\r\n<th class=\"table-column-width--20pct\">Charge Cost</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Cure Wounds (level 9 version)</td>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Daylight</td>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Death Ward</td>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Detect Magic</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Scrying (save DC 18)</td>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><em><strong>Call Dragons.</strong></em> While you control the orb, you can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Destroying an Orb.</strong></em> An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has AC 20 and is destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon or a Disintegrate spell. Nothing else can harm it.</p>",

On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the <em>Portable Hole</em>.

For example, a <em>Ring of Elemental Command</em> (air) is linked to the Elemental Plane of Air. Every <em>Ring of Elemental Command</em> has the following two properties:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Elemental Bane.</strong> While wearing the ring, you have Advantage on attack rolls against Elementals and they have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Elemental Compulsion.</strong> While wearing the ring, you can take a Magic action to try to compel an Elemental you see within 60 feet of yourself. The Elemental makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the Elemental has the Charmed condition until the start your next turn, and you determine what it does with its move and action on its next turn.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Elemental Focus.</strong></em> While wearing the ring, you benefit from additional properties corresponding to the ring’s linked Elemental Plane:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Air.</strong> You know Auran, you have Resistance to Lightning damage, and you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed and can hover.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Earth.</strong> You know Terran, and you have Resistance to Acid damage. Terrain composed of rubble, rocks, or dirt isn’t Difficult Terrain for you. In addition, you can move through solid earth or rock as if those areas were Difficult Terrain without disturbing the matter through which you pass. If you end your turn in solid earth or rock, you are shunted out to the nearest unoccupied space you last occupied.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fire.</strong> You know Ignan, and you have Immunity to Fire damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Water.</strong> You know Aquan, you gain a Swim Speed of 60 feet, and you can breathe underwater.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Spellcasting.</strong></em> The ring has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can cast a spell from it. Choose the spell from the list of available spells based on the Elemental Plane the ring is linked to, as shown in the following table. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell, which has a save DC of 18.</p>\r\n<table class=\"table-compendium table--left-all\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Plane</th>\r\n<th>Spells (Charges)</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Air</td>\r\n<td>Chain Lightning (3 charges), Feather Fall (0 charges), Gust of Wind (2 charges), Wind Wall (1 charge)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Earth</td>\r\n<td>Earthquake (5 charges), Stone Shape (2 charges), Stoneskin (3 charges), Wall of Stone (3 charges)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Fire</td>\r\n<td>Burning Hands (1 charge), Fireball (2 charges), Fire Storm (4 charges), Wall of Fire (3 charges)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Water</td>\r\n<td>Create or Destroy Water (1 charge), Ice Storm (2 charges), Tsunami (5 charges), Wall of Ice (3 charges), Water Walk (2 charges)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>",

The flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Button 2.</strong> The rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Button 3.</strong> The rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Button 4.</strong> The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Button 5.</strong> The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Button 6.</strong> The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north.

When it does, it magically appears wherever the demon lord senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.</p>\r\n<p>The wand is topped with a skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. All Holy Water within 10 feet of the wand is destroyed.</p>\r\n<p>Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 Necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and, if it is a Humanoid, turns into a Zombie.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Magic Weapon.</strong></em> You can wield the wand as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 Necrotic damage on a hit.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The <em>Wand of Orcus</em> has the following random properties:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\r\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\r\n<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>\r\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The detrimental properties of the <em>Wand of Orcus</em> are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Protection.</strong></em> You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.</p>\r\n<table class=\"table-compendium table--left-all\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Spell</th>\r\n<th>Charge Cost</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Animate Dead</td>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Blight</td>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Circle of Death</td>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Finger of Death</td>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Power Word Kill</td>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Speak with Dead</td>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand’s spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Call Undead.</strong></em> While holding the wand, you can take a Magic action to conjure 15 Skeletons and 15 Zombies. These Undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until the next dawn, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property, you can’t use it again until the next dawn.</p>\r\n<p>While holding the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of Undead, not just skeletons and zombies. These Undead don’t perish at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The <em>Wand of Orcus</em> is a sentient Chaotic Evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.</p>\r\n<p>The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Abyssal and Common.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The wand’s purpose is to help satisfy Orcus’s desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.</p>\r\n<p>To further Orcus’s goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Wand.</strong></em> Destroying the <em>Wand of Orcus</em> requires that it be taken to the Positive Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life&mdash;no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero’s soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.</p>\r\n<p>Bathing the wand in positive energy (such as that which permeates the Positive Plane) causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly re-forms on Orcus’s layer of the Abyss.</p>",

You can cast a spell on the Eye of Vecna Spells table from the eye (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Goat of Terror.</strong></em> This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 Lance, and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days have passed.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Goat of Traveling.</strong></em> This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Goat of Travail.</strong></em> This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Of all the magic items created by elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a <em>Moonblade</em>. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such weapon. Over the centuries, some of these weapons have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Others have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.</p>\r\n<p>Every <em>Moonblade</em> longs for a bearer whose disposition and goals are compatible with its own. If you try to attune to a <em>Moonblade</em> that doesn’t want you as its bearer, the weapon not only rejects you but also places a curse on you, causing you to make D20 Tests with Disadvantage for 24 hours or until the curse is ended by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic. If you’re accepted by the weapon and try to attune to it, you become attuned to it instantly, and a new rune appears on it. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A <em>Moonblade</em> functions like a nonmagical weapon of its kind for anyone other than its chosen bearer.</p>\r\n<p>A <em>Moonblade</em> has one rune on it for each bearer it has willingly served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the <em>Moonblade</em> an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly by rolling on the Moonblade Properties table.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Minor Property.</strong></em> In addition to its aforementioned properties, each <em>Moonblade</em> has a minor property determined by rolling on the Magic Item’s Minor Property table.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> A <em>Moonblade</em> is a sentient weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet. Its alignment matches that of its creator.</p>\r\n<p>The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder’s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate through visions or dreams when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> A <em>Moonblade</em> has a personality similar to that of its creator. Once a <em>Moonblade</em> has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the bearer’s alignment differs from that of the weapon’s or the bearer’s goals later clash with the weapon’s goals.</p>\r\n<table class=\"table-compendium table--generic-dice\" style=\"--sb-table-row-bg-hover: #b3d3df; --sb-table-row-bg-dark: #d7e8ee; --sb-table-row-bg-light: #f1f7f9; --dark-sb-table-row-bg-light: #5e7982; --dark-sb-table-row-bg-dark: #5c7f8c; --dark-sb-table-row-bg-hover: #78a2b0;\"><caption>Moonblade Properties</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>1d100</th>\r\n<th>Property</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>01-60</td>\r\n<td>Increase the weapon’s bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3.
