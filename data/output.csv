Abjurer’s Bangle,"Wondrous item, rarity varies
You can clasp or remove this metal bracelet around the 
wrist or ankle of yourself or a willing creature within 
your reach using an action. The bangle emits a ward of 
abjuration magic from it that has a number of hit points 
determined by its rarity. A creature wearing the bangle 
can use its reaction when it takes damage to speak the 
bangle’s command word, causing the magical ward to 
take the damage instead. Any excess damage carries 
over to the creature when the bangle’s ward is reduced 
to 0 hit points, at which point the bangle becomes a 
nonmagical bracelet.

"
Aged Goodberry Wine,"Potion, rare
This bottle of thick red wine is miraculously made from 
magical goodberries and peonies using a closely kept 
family recipe. It tastes fruity and floral, with notes of 
honey and the feeling of a fresh breeze, and is deeply 
rejuvenating. The bottle comes with 8 servings of the 
syrupy potion, which each take 1 minute to drink.

to the total of the roll.
"
Air Render,"Weapon (shortbow), rare (requires attunement)
When you make a ranged attack with this magic bow, 
you can choose to fire a mote of wind instead of using an 
arrow. When you do, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack 
and damage rolls, and you can choose the form the wind 
takes, causing it to deal either bludgeoning, piercing, or 
slashing damage (your choice). When you roll a 20 on an 
attack roll made in this way, the target also suffers from 
one of the following effects:
Bludgeoning Gust.
 If the mote of wind dealt 
bludgeoning damage, the target must succeed on a 
DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone 
or pushed 15 feet away from you (your choice). If the 
target is Huge or larger, it automatically succeeds on the 
saving throw.
Piercing Wind.
 If the mote of wind dealt piercing 
damage, you can immediately make another attack with 
the same mote of wind against a different creature that 
is within 15 feet of the original target. This attack deals 
piercing damage.
Slashing Tornado.
 If the mote of wind dealt slashing 
damage, each other creature within 5 feet of the original 
target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw 
or take 2d6 slashing damage.
"
Alchemist’s Potion Belt,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This enchanted belt has two stoppers that magically 
resize to fit the mouth of any kind of bottle. The belt can 
carry up to two potions in this way. The belt can be worn 
comfortably around your waist or across your chest as 
a bandolier. While wearing the belt, any potion carried 
on it seems to magically unstopper and spring to your 
hand, allowing you to drink it as a bonus action. You can 
attach a bottle to the belt using an action.

ship and a crashing wave of blue glass. While wearing 
this amulet, you can use your reaction to immediately 
stand up when you’re knocked prone. When you do, 
your speed is halved until the end of your next turn. In 
addition, if you start your turn underwater with 0 hit 
points, you immediately rise 60 feet toward the surface.
"
Amulet of Immutability,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This adamantine amulet protects you from magic that 
would threaten to alter your form against your will. 
While wearing the amulet, you have advantage on saving 
throws against transmutation spells of 5th level or lower 
that would transform or control you, such as

saving throw.
"
Amulet of the Lycanthrope,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This rounded amulet depicts a harrowing crescent 
moon with blood-red claw marks running through its 
center. The markings emit a dim red light on the day of 
a full moon.
If you’re not a lycanthrope, you can use a bonus action 
while wearing the amulet to assume a more bestial 
appearance, taking on the claws and defining features 
of either a bear, rat, tiger, or wolf (your choice). This 
transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you drop 
to 0 hit points or use a bonus action to revert to your 
normal form. For the duration, you can use your claws 
as natural weapons when making unarmed strikes. If 
you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 
1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning 
damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, 
you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
that rely on hearing or smell for the duration of the 
transformation. This property can’t be used again for 
12 hours or until the next dusk, whichever comes first. 
Alternatively, if it’s within 24 hours of a full moon, this 
property can be used again after 6 hours, instead of 12.
If you’re already a lycanthrope and are wearing the 
amulet, your claw and bite attacks while in your animal 
or hybrid forms deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage 
and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming 
resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and 
damage. In addition, your bite attack save DC increases 
by 3.
Curse.
 This amulet is cursed, and becoming attuned 
to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain 
cursed, you have disadvantage on saving throws made to 
resist becoming cursed by lycanthropy.

Amulet of the Sentinel,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This golden amulet of an eye has a large ruby embedded 
in its center and eight smaller gems around it. The 
amulet has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended 
charges daily at dawn. While wearing this amulet, you 
can expend 1 or more of its charges to use one of the 
following properties:
Alertness.
 When you roll for initiative, you can use 
your reaction to expend 1 charge to add your proficiency 
bonus to the roll.
Protection.
 When a creature that you can see within 
30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can use your 
reaction to expend 2 charges to turn that hit into a 
normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are 
canceled.
Vigilance.
 When one or more creatures that you can 
see within 30 feet of you are forced to make a saving 
throw, you can use your reaction to expend 2 or more 
charges. For 2 charges, you grant one affected creature 
of your choice advantage on the saving throw. For each 
additional charge you expend, you grant one more 
affected creature of your choice advantage on the saving 
throw. You make this choice after you see the roll, but 
before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
"
Amulet of the Spirit Naga,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
While wearing this platinum pendant, you are immune 
to the poisoned condition and have immunity to poison 
damage.

immediately return to life with half your hit points. This 
property restores any missing body parts, neutralizes 
any poisons, and cures normal diseases afflicting you 
when you died, but has no effect if you die of old age. 
Once you’re returned to life in this way, the amulet loses 
this property.
"
Angler’s Armor,"Armor (scale mail), uncommon (requires attunement)
This magic armor was hand-made by a clan of proud 
fishers. The armor is made of countless hardened scales 
lining a reinforced leather jacket, making it a sturdy 
and weather proof option for sailors. While wearing this 
armor, you gain a swimming speed of 30 feet, and the 
normal and long ranges of nets are doubled for you. In 
addition, when you fish while wearing this armor, you 
catch twice as many fish as you normally would.
"
Angler’s Worldly Fisher,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This magic fishing rod can be used anywhere on the Ma-
terial Plane to fish from the world’s waters. While hold-
ing this fishing rod, you can use an action to speak its 
command word and cast it at a point you can see within 
30 feet of you. When you do, the end of the line vanishes 
at the point and magically reappears somewhere else in 
the Material Plane in a random body of water. Despite 
not being able to see the end of the rod’s line, you can 
still feel it being tugged at by the water’s currents. Any 
fish you catch in this way reappear at the point where 
you cast the line. You have advantage on ability checks 
to catch fish while using this fishing rod.
"
Ao Hai’s Fang,"Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by a 
monk)
This ancient sword was forged in a kingdom ruled by 
a tyrannical dragon that has long since sunken to the 
bottom of the ocean. While attuned to 
Ao Hai’s fang
, you 
are proficient with it. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which is a 
monk weapon for you.
Dragon King’s Wrath.
 As a bonus action, you can 
spend 4 ki points to channel the fury of a powerful 
dragon and enter a magical rage. While raging in this 
way, you gain the following benefits:
 
y
 If you aren’t wearing armor, dragon-like scales cover 
your body, granting you a +1 bonus to AC.
 
y
 You can’t be charmed or frightened.
 
y
 You can make one attack with this weapon as a 
bonus action on each of your turns, and when you 
use your Flurry of Blows, you can make two attacks 
with this weapon instead of two unarmed strikes.
 
y
 When a creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses 
you with an attack, you can use your reaction to 
make an attack with this weapon against that 
creature immediately after its attack.
This rage lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you are 
knocked unconscious. You can also end your rage on 
your turn as a bonus action. This property can’t be used 
again until the next dawn.
"
Appraiser’s Eye,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a creature 
missing an eye)
This golden sphere is the size of an eyeball with a 
bejeweled iris. Its weight is negligible. The sphere has 
3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at 
dawn. Even if you aren’t attuned to the sphere, you can 
use it and its charges for the following properties.
While holding the eye, you can use an action to 
expend 1 of its charges to cast the 
identify
 spell from 
it. Alternatively, you can use the eye as the material 
component required for the 
legend lore
 spell. When you 
do, there is only a cumulative 10 percent chance that the 
sphere is consumed by the spell.
While you’re attuned to the sphere, it also functions 
like a normal eye while it’s in your socket, and you 
have advantage on Intelligence checks you make to 
determine an item’s value, as well as on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks that rely on sight. In addition, if 
you cast 
legend lore
 and use the sphere as the material 
component for the spell while you’re attuned to it, the 
10 percent chance that the sphere is consumed by the 
spell isn’t cumulative, and in the event that the sphere 
is consumed by the spell, it loses this property and can 
no longer be used as a component for the spell, but isn’t 
destroyed.
"
Arborguard Shield,"Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)
This massive wooden shield was made using the bark of 
an ancient treant. While holding it, you have a +1 bonus 
to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal 
bonus to AC.
While holding this shield, you can speak its command 
word as an action to create a wall of up to twelve trees 
on a solid surface within 120 feet of you. Each tree is 
5 feet across at its base, up to 20 feet tall, and must 
be contiguous with another tree. Alternatively, you can 
create a ringed wall of trees up to 25 feet in diameter 
centered on your space. The trees grow tightly next to 
each other, preventing movement between them and 
providing total cover to anything behind them. A tree 
only grows a canopy if there is room for it.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it 
appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one 
side of the wall and must make a DC 16 Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 
bludgeoning or piercing damage (your choice), or half as 
much damage on a successful save.
The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus 
breached. Each tree has AC 13, 20 hit points, and is 
vulnerable to fire damage. A tree disappears when it 
drops to 0 hit points or when the effect ends.
While you’re within 30 feet of the wall, you can see 
through a tree’s space (no action required) using your 
senses. When you make a melee weapon attack while 
within 30 feet of one or more of the trees, you can make 
the attack as if you were in one of the trees’ spaces. 
When you do, the tree magically forms a wooden copy of 
you and any weapon you’re holding to make the attack: 
duplicating any of its effects.
The wall lasts as long as you concentrate (as if 
concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute, 
or until it’s dispelled by a 
dispel magic
 spell of 6th-level 
or higher, or until you are no longer holding the shield. 
Once this property of the shield has been used, it can’t 
be used again until the next dawn.
"
Arc of the Alicorn,"Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)
This magic ivory bow is sculpted to look like a pair 
of curved unicorn horns and is strung with the finely 
braided hair of a pegasus’ mane. This bow’s damage die 
is a d10 instead of a d8.
The bow has 4 charges for the following properties. It 
regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
Flight.
 While holding the bow, you can use a bonus 
action to expend 1 of its charges to cause small wings 
to appear on your feet that last until the end of your 
turn. For the duration, you have a flying speed of 90 
feet. While the wings remain, you can choose to expend 
another charge from the bow at the end of each of your 
turns (no action required) to extend the wings’ duration 
until the end of your next turn.
Healing Horn.
 While holding the bow, you can use a 
bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to fire a magical 
arrow of pure light at a creature that you can see within 
60 feet of you, causing that creature to regain 2d6 + 2 
hit points.
Trampling Arrow.
 When you make a ranged attack 
with the bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause 
the fired arrow to transform into a spectral, charging 
pegasus. On a hit, the target takes an extra 3d6 force 
damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving 
throw or be knocked prone. If the target of the attack 
is already prone, you ignore the normal disadvantage 
imposed on ranged attack rolls against prone creatures 
and make the roll with advantage instead.
"
Arcanist Gauntlets,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This pair of rich silk gloves is guarded by an enchanted 
mithral shell that sporadically releases arcane power. 
You can use the gauntlets as a spellcasting focus while 
wearing them, and when you cast a spell using a spell 
slot of 5th level or lower, you can choose to roll a d6. 
If you roll a number on the d6 equal to or greater than 
the spell’s slot level, the spell draws on the magic within 
the gauntlets, instead of your own, and is cast without 
expending a spell slot. The slot must be of a level you 
can normally cast. The gauntlets can provide up to 5 
levels worth of spell slots in this way each day, and no 
two slots can be the same level.
If the number rolled on the d6 is less than the spell 
slot’s level, you cast the spell as normal and expend 
the spell slot. If you don’t have the spell slot to cast the 
spell, the spell fails and the slot is counted toward the 
gauntlets’ daily provided spell slots.
For example, a 9th-level wizard can use the gauntlets 
to provide either one 5th-level spell slot or a 4th- and 
1st-level spell slot over the course of a day, but not two 
2nd- or 3rd-level spell slots.
"
Arcanist’s Magnificent Magnifier,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This magical magnifying glass helps deduce the arcane 
nature of items. While looking through the glass at an 
object within 1 foot of you, your proficiency bonus is 
doubled for any Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence 
(Investigation) check you make regarding that object’s 
magical properties. In addition, you can speak the 
glass’s command word as an action to cast the 
identify
 
spell from it, targeting an object with the spell that you 
can see through the glass within 1 foot of you. Each time 
you do, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance that the 
glass shatters and is destroyed after casting the spell.
"
Arcanist’s Scribing Wand,"Wand, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)
This wand’s handle has a fountain pen nib at its end that 
releases its own magical ink. When you use this pen to 
copy a spell into your spellbook, the gold it takes to do 
so is halved. Swinging the wand causes tiny droplets of 
illusory ink to trail behind it.
The wand has 7 charges for the following properties:
Spells.
 While holding the wand, you can use an action 
to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following 
spells from it: 
comprehend languages
 (written language 
only) or 
illusory script
.
Cloudscript.
 While holding the wand, you can use 
an action to expend 2 of its charges to cause up to 10 
words to appear in the sky. The words are formed from 
wisps of clouds or smoke (your choice) and remain in 
place as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating 
on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until a wind of 
moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) 
disperses them.
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. 
On a 1, the wand dissolves into a puddle of mundane ink 
and is destroyed.
"
Archivist’s Key,"Wondrous item, very rare
This magical key is one of several made by a secret 
order of historians and archivists. While holding the 
key, you can use an action to twist the key, as if you were 
unlocking a door. When you do, a magical, spectral 
door slowly appears in front of you over the course 
of 1 minute, duplicating the effect of the 
magnificent 
mansion
 spell with the following change. The dwelling 
always includes a large library that magically includes 
copies of books, scrolls, maps, and more. The library 
does not count toward the total amount of space created 
by the spell. Its contents are strangely organized and 
seemingly change each time the key is used. A creature 
can visit the library and attempt to uncover a piece 
of knowledge, such as ancient poetry, the history of a 
forgotten kingdom, or the family lineage of a tyrannical 
king. The GM determines the checks and DCs needed 
to locate a given piece of information. For example, a 
book of foreign nursery rhymes may be easy to find, but 
a copy of necromantic research documents would be 
extremely difficult, if not impossible.
When the spell ends, the key can’t be used this way 
again for 24 hours.
"
Armor of Icarus,"Armor (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)
This sculpted breastplate has a pair of small mechanical 
wings attached to its back. You gain a +1 bonus to AC 
while wearing this armor. The armor has 6 charges and 
regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While 
wearing the armor, you can use an action to expend 1 
of its charges to magically unfurl the mechanical wings 
and fly up to 60 feet in a straight line toward a point 
of bright light that you can see (such as a torch, 
light
 
spell, or the sun) without provoking opportunity attacks. 
The wings remain unfurled until you touch the ground, 
during which time you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round 
and gain a flying speed of 30 feet, which you can use to 
glide horizontally as you descend. While gliding in this 
way, you cannot fly upwards unless you use the armor to 
fly toward a point of bright light again. When you land 
on the ground while falling in this way, the mechanical 
wings refold themselves to your back, and you take no 
damage from falling.
"
Arrow of Anchoring,"Weapon (arrow or bolt), uncommon
This magic piece of ammunition weighs 1 pound but 
otherwise flies exactly like a normal arrow or bolt. 
When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this 
ammunition, that creature must make a DC 13 Strength 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is grappled 
by the arrow for 1 minute as the chain magically 
extends and wraps around the target. On a success, the 
creature’s speed is halved until the start of your next 
turn instead. A creature grappled by the arrow in this 
way can use an action to repeat the saving throw, ending 
the effect and freeing itself on a success.
After this effect ends, the ammunition clatters to the 
ground and becomes a 2-foot length of nonmagical 
chain.
"
Astral Caltrops,"Wondrous item, rare
As an action, you can spread these magic caltrops over 
a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that 
enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 
piercing damage. When this happens, the caltrops 
explode in a burst of extraplanar energy, destroying the 
caltrops and dealing 6d6 force damage to the creature 
and causing it to rise vertically up to 20 feet, as if by 
the 
levitate
 spell. The creature remains suspended in 
this way for 1d4 rounds, during which time its speed 
becomes 0. The effect ends early if the creature takes 
any damage.
When the caltrops are spread on the ground, they 
become nearly invisible and float up to 1 inch off the 
ground. A creature notices the caltrops with a successful 
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. You can reclaim the 
invisible caltrops for later use with 1 minute of careful 
searching and collecting. The caltrops stop floating and 
become visible once they’re reclaimed in this way.
"
Astronomer’s Boon,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This brass astrolabe has a glass back that sparkles 
softly when light shines through it. While looking 
through the glass at the night sky, the names and 
patterns of any constellation you can see appear 
alongside their stars on the astrolabe. At the GM’s 
discretion, you may find one or more of the following 
constellations while looking through the glass. When 
you do, the astrolabe begins to glow, and you can use 
an action to speak the item’s command word to gain the 
constellation’s respective benefit:
The Drum.
 3 stars appear on your back in the shape 
of a drum. When you roll for initiative, you can expend 
1 of the stars as a reaction to grant you and any other 
friendly creature within 10 feet of you a +1 bonus to 
the roll. In addition, any creature that gains this bonus 
to initiative can use a bonus action on its first turn of 
combat to take either the Dash or Disengage action.
The Knight.
 5 stars appear on your arm in the shape 
of a sword. When you hit with a melee attack, you can 
choose to expend 1 of the stars as part of the attack to 
cause the target to take an extra 1d4 radiant damage. 
Alternatively, if a friendly creature within 30 feet of 
you that you can see hits a target with a melee attack, 
you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the stars and 
empower the attack with light, causing the target to take 
an extra 1d4 radiant damage.
The Seer.
 4 stars appear on your forehead in the 
shape of an eye. You can use a bonus action to expend 1 
of the stars and touch a creature. Once within the next 
10 minutes, that creature can choose to add 1d4 to an 
ability check or saving throw that it makes. It can choose 
to roll the die before or after making the ability check or 
saving throw.
The stars remain until the next dusk, at which point 
any unused stars vanish and are lost. Once the astrolabe 
has granted a benefit in this way, it can’t be used again 
until the next dusk.
"
Aurora Dust,"Wondrous item, common
This bag is filled with 1d6 + 4 pinches of iridescent blue 
dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over 
an open flame. The dust changes the flame’s color and 
light to a mixture of blue, green, and purple, and creates 
a shimmering aurora the same color above it within 
the bright light. The dust’s effect lasts for the flame’s 
duration (up to 24 hours).
"
Badge of the Savant,"Wondrous item, uncommon
A 
badge of the savant
 is a platinum bookplate that can 
be magically affixed to a wizard’s spellbook. Each badge 
features a design that represents a different school of 
magic. While a badge is attached to the cover of your 
spellbook, the gold and time you must spend to copy a 
spell of that badge’s school of magic into your spellbook 
is halved. You can collect multiple of these plates and fit 
them onto the cover of your spellbook, allowing you to 
gain this benefit for multiple schools of magic at once.
You can use an action to attach or remove a badge 
from a spellbook by expending a spell slot of a level 
equal to 1 plus the number of badges already on the 
book (a maximum of a 9th level spell slot).
"
Badge of the Wayfarer,"Wondrous item, rare
This badge is formed in the shape of a maple leaf with 
an embossed porcelain mug. While wearing the badge, 
you can recite its command phrase over the course of 
1 minute to cast the 
plane shift
 spell using the badge. 
When cast in this way, the spell’s destination can only 
be the Wayfarer’s Respite on the Astral Plane, an inn 
and pub of legend that drifts throughout the astral sea. 
The inn has no doors leading outside and can only be 
entered using the badge. Inside, the Wayfarer’s Respite 
is large, comfortable, and decadent. It’s frequently 
busy, despite its exclusivity, but always seems to have 
enough room and beds available for the wayward band 
of adventurers. The inn is expensive and suited for an 
aristocratic lifestyle, but is known to be willing to barter 
or trade for treasure, information, and favors.
"
Bag of Bellstones,"Wondrous item, common
This cloth bag shines like brass and can hold up to 20 
small stones. When found, the bag has 1d12 + 8 stones 
inside. When you remove a stone that’s been in the bag 
for at least 1 minute, it becomes magical until the end 
of the turn, if it isn’t already. While a stone is magical in 
this way, it emits a clear, bell-like ringing that’s audible 
out to a range of 60 feet whenever it hits a target or 
touches an object or surface.
"
Ball of Wild Earth,"Wondrous item, common
This Tiny, sentient pebble is covered in dirt and is likely 
a remnant of a charmed earth elemental. It rolls about 
on its own in search of new and unique sources of dirt. 
When it finds a patch of particularly rich soil, the ball 
rolls around in it to incorporate the dirt into its form. 
The ball carries captured moisture inside itself, allowing 
it to make its form either dusty or clay-like in texture, as 
well as hard or soft to the touch. A friendly 
ball of wild 
earth
 can magically reshape the dirt it’s covered in to 
form a variety of shapes at will, such as a tiny figurine or 
a large die, provided that the dirt continues to cover the 
pebble at its center by doing so.
The 
ball of wild earth
 is considered a magical object 
and is not a creature. It has a speed of 10 feet and can 
only move by rolling across the ground. It has AC 10, 
15 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. The ball 
regains all its hit points if it’s left buried underground 
for at least 1 hour.
Sentience.
 The 
ball of wild earth
 is a sentient neutral 
item with an Intelligence of 2, a Wisdom of 6, and a 
Charisma of 4. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 60 feet. It can’t speak or read, but understands 
Common and Terran.
Personality.
 The 
ball of wild earth
 is most happy 
when rolling through rich, healthy soil. Most can be 
found, at least initially, in mountainous farmlands, but 
even urban ones can enjoy the dust and traces of weird, 
foreign dirt that are ever-present in well-traveled cities. 
The quickest way to make a 
ball of wild earth 
happy is 
to give it gemstone dust to roll in, whereas removing the 
dirt and mud that surround its central pebble is certain 
to upset it. By reforming the dirt covering its form, the 
ball can make vague facial expressions based on the 
emotions its seen other creatures make.
"
Ballista Prosthesis,"Weapon (crossbow, hand), uncommon (requires attunement 
by a creature missing an arm, forearm, or hand)
A 
ballista prosthesis
 is a magical weapon composed of 
numerous complex mechanical pieces that allow it to act 
as a functional prosthetic arm. You gain a +1 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 
This crossbow has an internal magazine that can hold 
up to 20 bolts. While there are bolts in the magazine, 
the crossbow does not have the loading property. It 
takes 1 minute to reload the magazine.
The prosthesis attaches to your arm at the elbow or 
the shoulder, and it can’t be removed against your will 
as long as you’re attuned to it. To attune to this item, you 
must hold it against your arm for the entire attunement 
period. While attuned to the prosthesis, you can use an 
action to remove or reattach it.
As a bonus action, you can retract the crossbow’s 
limbs to the side of your hand or extend them from 
there. While retracted, the crossbow is concealed and 
functions identically to a normal hand. A creature 
can use an action to make a DC 13 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check, identifying its crossbow 
components and determining that it’s a concealed 
weapon on a success. While extended, you can use the 
weapon as if you were holding it, and you can’t use that 
hand for other purposes.
"
Bandolier of the Elements,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This cross-chest bandolier has 6 magic daggers 
sheathed across it. When you take the Attack action 
while wearing this bandolier, you can use a bonus action 
to throw 1 of the daggers, making a ranged attack with 
it, provided you have a free hand. When you hit a target 
with one of these daggers, roll a d6 and consult the table 
below. The target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the type 
determined by the table, in addition to the weapon’s 
damage, and the dagger disappears. On a miss, the 
dagger vanishes and reappears in the bandolier.
A dagger vanishes if you don’t hurl it right away and 
immediately reappears in the bandolier. 1d6 missing 
daggers reappear in the bandolier’s empty sheaths daily 
at dawn.

"
Bane Shield,"Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement)
This classic iron shield is emblazoned with the skull-
like face of a demon. The shield has 3 charges and 
regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you 
take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you while 
holding this shield, you can use your reaction to expend 
1 of its charges to curse that creature. The next time 
that creature makes an ability check or attack roll before 
the end of its next turn, it must roll a d4 and subtract the 
number rolled from the total.
"
Bartender’s Armistice,"Wondrous item, rare
A 
bartender’s armistice
 is a magical coaster typically 
kept by wary tavernkeepers for cases of extreme danger. 
When found, a 
bartender’s armistice 
comes in a set of 
1d3 + 1 coasters. Each coaster is 4 inches across, and 
its weight is negligible.
As an action, you can speak the coaster’s command 
word and throw it at a point on the ground you can see 
within 30 feet of you. When you do, the coaster becomes 
fixed in place at the point and emits a magical field in 
a 30-foot-radius, 15-foot-high cylinder that’s centered 
on it. Each creature within the area must make a DC 
15 Charisma saving throw when the field appears or 
when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or 
starts its turn there. A creature can choose to fail this 
saving throw if it wishes. On a failed save, a creature 
is charmed by you while it remains within the field. 
A charmed creature is indifferent about creatures it 
can see that it’s hostile toward. This indifference ends 
if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell, or if it 
witnesses any of its friends being harmed. If you or your 
companions harm a charmed creature or its friends, the 
charm ends. When the charm or field ends, the creature 
becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.
When a creature makes an attack or casts a harmful 
spell that either affects a target within the field or enters 
or leaves the field’s area, that creature must first make a 
DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attack 
or spell fails and is expended, and the action is wasted.
Each creature within the field has advantage on any 
Charisma (Persuasion) check it makes to deescalate a 
violent situation. In addition, if a creature in the area 
is unconscious when the field appears, it immediately 
stabilizes if it has 0 hit points.
The coaster has AC 15 and 25 hit points. The field 
remains for 10 minutes or until the coaster drops to 0 
hit points, at which point the coaster is destroyed and 
the field ends. If the field ends after the full duration, 
there is a 10 percent chance that the coaster remains 
magical and can be used again. Otherwise, the coaster 
becomes nonmagical.
"
Battlechef Field Dresser,"Weapon (dagger), uncommon (requires attunement)
This sharp knife is enchanted with five fiery runes that 
magically heat its edge. Its sharp blade is intentionally 
designed to quickly prepare fresh cuts of meat from 
slain creatures. When you hit with an attack using 
this magic dagger, the target takes an extra 1d4 fire 
damage. In addition, when you reduce a living beast or 
monstrosity that you can see within 5 feet of you to 0 
hit points using this weapon, you can quickly slice off a 
small, prime cut of its flesh (no action required), cooking 
it in the process. When you do, you gain 1 ration.
"
Beads of Meditation,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This beaded necklace can be used as a set of prayer 
beads or special rosary. While wearing or holding 
the beads, you can use an action to end one effect on 
yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.
If you’re a cleric, monk, or paladin, you can use 
an action to hold onto the beads to further channel 
your spirituality. If you’re a monk, you regain 1d4 + 1 
expended ki points. If you’re a cleric or paladin, you 
regain one use of your Channel Divinity. This property 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Beard Cannon,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This item appears to be a wide, cylindrical hair cuff used 
for taming unruly hair. The cuff is 4 inches in height and 
diameter and weighs 1 pound. As part of attuning to 
the cuff, you must pull it onto your hair or beard, which 
must be at least one foot long in order to fit. When you 
finish attuning to the cuff, 6 smaller, spherical beads 
appear and weave themselves into the hair nearby.
When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one 
of your attacks to point the hair cuff at a target within 
range and speak its command word. When you do, the 
cuff magically retracts any hair pulled through it and 
fires 1 of the smaller beads through its exposed opening. 
Make a ranged weapon attack using the magic cuff, 
which has a normal range of 15 feet and a long range of 
30 feet. You are proficient with the attack. When fired, 
the spherical bead magically grows to become fist-sized, 
and it deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit.
After the attack, the retracted hair magically 
reappears through the cuff, and the fired bead is lost. 
1d6 fired beads magically reappear in your hair daily 
at dawn. When not in use as a weapon, the item is 
indistinguishable from a normal hair cuff.
"
Bell of Alarm,"Wondrous item, common
This brass bell doesn’t have a clapper inside it and 
has 4 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 of the 
bell’s charges to shake it and speak its command word, 
followed by a total number of hours, minutes, or seconds 
equal to no more than 8 hours. After the specified 
amount of time has passed, the bell emits a loud ringing 
in your ears that’s audible to only you, provided that 
you’re within 1 mile of the bell and are on the same 
plane of existence. You can mentally end a timer at any 
time using a bonus action.
The bell regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
"
Bellhop Topper,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This deep purple top hat is ringed with a velvet ribbon 
and secured with leather straps and belts. The hat has 
3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at 
dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 of the hat’s 
charges and speak its command word, tossing it onto 
the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. 
When you do, the hat magically flattens and expands 
into a purple, circular disk 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch 
thick. The disk duplicates the effect of the 
floating disk
 
spell, except that the disk is opaque and remains within 
10 feet of you, instead of 20. You can end the spell early 
using an action to speak the hat’s command word again. 
When the spell ends, the disk transforms back into the 
hat.
"
Belt of the Hell Hound,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
When you wear this belt, you can feel the fires of the 
lower planes burn inside you. While wearing the belt, 
when you make a melee attack against a creature and 
have advantage on the attack, the target takes an extra 
1d6 fire damage from the attack on a hit.
In addition, while wearing this belt, you can use an 
action to release a hellish howl. When you do, you 
exhale a plume of flames from your mouth in a 15-foot 
cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 
15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t 
being worn or carried. Once this property has been 
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Curse.
 Once you wear this belt, you can’t remove it 
unless you are targeted by the 
remove curse
 spell or 
similar magic. While wearing the belt, you must eat 
twice the normal amount of food each day (a minimum 
of 2 pounds) to avoid exhaustion. In addition, while 
wearing the belt, there is a cumulative 10 percent 
chance when you die and again at the end of each hour 
you remain dead that you immediately immolate and 
turn to ash.
"
Bird’s-Eye Bolt,"Weapon (arrow or bolt), common
As an action, you can fire this piece of magic 
ammunition into the air above you, causing it to 
disappear into a dusting of feathers and be destroyed. 
The ammunition creates an invisible sensor in an 
unoccupied space that you can see up to 120 feet 
directly above you. The sensor remains for 1 minute or 
until you move more than 120 feet away from where you 
first fired the ammunition. For the duration, you can use 
an action to see and hear through the sensor as if you 
were in its space until the start of your next turn. If the 
ammunition hits a target, it’s no longer magical.
A creature that can see the sensor (such as a 
creature benefiting from 
see invisibility
 or truesight) 
sees a luminous, intangible bird about the size of a fist 
fluttering in the air.
"
Blackthorn Spear of the Moonless Hunter,"Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement)
This spiny, black bone spear is a favorite among 
nocturnal hunting tribes. While attuned to the spear, 
you can always see the faint outline of it, even in total 
darkness. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage 
rolls made with this magic weapon.
This spear contains a fragment of the moonless 
hunter, an ancient spirit that can be channeled to 
assume some of its powers. While holding the spear, 
you can use a bonus action to call forth and assume the 
spirit of the moonless hunter. While assuming the spirit, 
your eyes become pure white, and you gain the following 
benefits:
 
y
 You ignore the effects of exhaustion.
 
y
 You can’t sleep or be put to sleep by magical means, 
and you can’t take or benefit from finishing a long 
rest.
 
y
 You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
 
y
 You can see normally in darkness, both magical and 
nonmagical, out to a range of 60 feet.
 
y
 You can use a bonus action to cause the spear to fly 
back to your empty hand or land at your feet (your 
choice), provided that the spear is within 60 feet of 
you.
 
y
 Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
You can assume the spirit in this way for up to 8 
hours. The effect ends early if you release the spirit as a 
bonus action or if you’re farther than 60 feet away from 
the spear for more than 1 minute. The spirit returns to 
the spear when you are no longer assuming it, at which 
point you gain 1 level of exhaustion for every 2 hours 
you assumed the spirit (minimum 1 level). Exhaustion 
gained in this way can only be reduced by finishing a 
long rest.
"
Blood Moon Blade,"Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)
This fine blade is crafted from a strange black metal and 
bears a hole above the hilt that seems to draw in blood. 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon.
When you hit a Small or larger living creature with 
this weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d4 necrotic 
damage and you regain hit points equal to half the 
amount of necrotic damage dealt in this way. Constructs, 
plants, and undead creatures are immune to this 
necrotic damage.
Curse.
 This sword is cursed, and becoming attuned 
to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain 
cursed, you are unwilling to part with the sword, keeping 
it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage 
on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless 
no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. 
In addition, while you remain cursed, the number of hit 
points you regain when healed by magical means (other 
than the sword’s effect) is halved.
"
Bloodhound Amulet,"Wondrous item, uncommon
While wearing this pendant, you have advantage on any 
ability check that relies on smell. In addition, you can 
use an action to focus on a particular scent. When you 
do, you perceive that smell visually as a cloud of red 
vapor for up to 1 hour. Once this property of the amulet 
has been used, it can’t be used again until the next 
dawn.
"
Bloodmire Phiale,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This shallow, ceramic drinking bowl is enchanted to 
repurpose spilled blood into new life. The bowl holds 
up to 8 ounces of blood. Once filled, the blood begins to 
slowly swirl on its own. If left to sit for 1 hour without 
spilling, the blood in the bowl becomes a gruesome 
tonic that pulses with a faint, internal glow.
Drinking the entire bowl of still blood causes one of 
two effects. Roll a d12. On a 12, you take 12 necrotic 
damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you 
are stable. On a roll of 11 or lower, you instead regain a 
number of hit points equal 4 + the number rolled. The 
blood is thick and sweet, but leaves a bitter aftertaste.
The blood’s magic fades if it’s poured from the bowl 
without being drunk. Once the bowl has been used 
in this way, it can’t be used again until 1d4 days have 
passed.
"
Bloodmire Rod of the Witch Doctor,"Rod, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, paladin, or 
warlock)
This gnarled wooden scepter from the Bloodmire is 
set with a strange, cracked opal at its head and can be 
used as a spellcasting focus. The rod has 6 charges and 
regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dusk.
While holding the rod, you can expend 1 of its charges 
as an action to create a magical tether of light between 
the rod and another creature you can see within 30 feet 
of you. The tether’s color and effects depend on what 
kind of tether you create. You can only have one of each 
tether at a time.
Empowering Tether.
 This tether is a brilliant white. 
A creature affected by this tether regains 2d10 hit points 
when it’s first affected by it, and while it’s connected 
to the tether, it deals an extra 1d10 damage of the 
weapon’s type to the first target it hits with a melee 
weapon attack on each of its turns. In addition, on each 
of your following turns while you maintain the tether, 
you can expend 1 of the rod’s charges as a bonus action 
to send a surge of healing magic through the tether and 
cause the target to regain 2d10 hit points.
Withering Tether.
 This tether is a sickly red. 
A creature affected by this tether must make a 
Constitution saving throw when it’s first affected by it, 
using your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature 
takes 2d10 necrotic damage, and on each of your 
following turns while you maintain the tether, you can 
use a bonus action to deal 1d10 necrotic damage to the 
target automatically. On a successful save, a creature 
takes half as much necrotic damage, and the tether 
immediately ends.
The tether ends after 1 minute. It ends early if you 
sever the tether (no action required), are no longer 
holding the rod, the target ends its turn more than 30 
feet away from you, the target has total cover from you, 
or if you or the target fall unconscious.
"
Bloodmire Soulflame Lantern,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This iron lantern is surrounded by six glass panels 
and has a sharp spike in its center where a wick would 
normally be. When you attune to the lantern, it suddenly 
springs to life with a crimson flame at the top of the 
spike, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim 
light for an additional 30 feet. The flame is magical 
and can’t be extinguished by any means while it burns 
within the lantern. While the lantern is on your person, 
you can use a bonus action to mentally expand or 
reduce the lantern’s light, to a maximum of 30 feet each 
or a minimum of 10 feet each. As part of this bonus 
action, you can also cause the lantern’s glass panels to 
magically turn black or clear, allowing you to choose 
whether the lantern’s light is shed in a radius, a cone, or 
entirely hidden by the darkened glass.
While the lantern is on your person, you gain the 
following benefits:
 
y
 You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
that rely on sight.
 
y
 You have resistance to necrotic damage and are 
immune to disease.
 
y
 When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed 
outright, you can use your reaction to spend one 
Hit Die to heal yourself. Roll the die, add your 
Constitution modifier, and regain a number of 
hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1). This 
property can’t be used again for 1d12 hours.
 
y
 When a creature within the lantern’s light (including 
you) reduces a living target to 0 hit points, that 
creature gains 1d8 temporary hit points.
 
y
 You see anything within the lantern’s bright light as 
if you had truesight.
 
y
 Any fiend or undead creature within the lantern’s 
bright light doesn’t gain the benefits of any damage 
resistances it may have, and if it has an ability that 
would normally take effect when the creature is 
reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn’t.
Curse.
 This lantern is cursed, and attuning to it 
extends that curse to you. You remain cursed as long as 
you remain attuned to the lantern, which can only be 
ended with a 
wish
 spell or by the touch of a powerful fey 
creature. Even if you die, your attunement to the lantern 
doesn’t end until 7 days have passed.
As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to 
part with the lantern, keeping it within reach at all 
times. In addition, you must continuously feed the 
lantern’s flame using your own vitality. Whenever you 
gain or spend any number of Hit Dice, you must also 
sacrifice one Hit Die to the lantern (if you have any). 
Alternatively, you can use an action to open the lantern’s 
door and hold your hand over the flame, sacrificing one 
of your Hit Dice when you do. If the lantern isn’t given 
any Hit Dice for 24 hours, you die, and the flame goes 
out until the lantern is attuned to by another creature or 
you return to life while still attuned to it.
"
Bloodshard Trident,"Weapon (trident), rare (requires attunement)
This magic trident has grooves in its obsidian surface 
that are used to channel blood in rituals of self-sacrifice. 
While holding the trident, you can use a bonus action to 
make a blood offering. When you do, choose a number 
of hit points to sacrifice. You take necrotic damage equal 
to the amount you sacrifice, which can’t be reduced 
or prevented in any way. For every 5 hit points you 
sacrifice, the trident creates 1 shard of magic obsidian, 
which floats alongside the trident’s three prongs for 1 
minute. You can have up to 3 shards in this way at a 
time. The trident deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage to 
any target it hits for each floating shard it has.
When you throw the trident while it has at least 
1 floating shard, the weapon flies back to your hand 
immediately after the attack.
"
Bloodthirster Scimitar,"Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)
This carefully carved bone scimitar belonged to a cult 
of vicious monks whose extraordinary bloodlust and 
strength have been all but entirely erased from history. 
While you hold this magic sword, you have resistance to 
necrotic damage.
When you take the Attack action while holding this 
sword, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to 
sacrifice your own blood. When you do, you take 1d6 
+ 3 piercing damage from the sacrifice. This damage 
ignores resistance and immunity. This self-inflicted 
harm empowers the sword, granting you a cumulative 
+1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this 
magic weapon that lasts for 1 minute, up to a maximum 
bonus of +3. While the sword is empowered in this way, 
it deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target it 
hits.
"
Bloodthirsty Bistoury,"Weapon (dagger), uncommon
This elegant, dark dagger is never bloodstained and 
effortlessly pierces flesh. You gain a +1 bonus to attack 
and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
When this dagger is used by an evil-aligned creature, 
any creature hit by it doesn’t bleed from the attack or the 
wound it leaves behind for 10 minutes.
"
Bloody Marilith,"Potion, common or very rare
The typical 
bloody marilith
, a common potion, is a 
specialty alcoholic beverage that fills your body with 
reactive energy. For 1 minute after drinking this potion, 
you can use a reaction even if you’ve already taken 
one since the end of your last turn. Once you take this 
reaction, the potion’s effect ends. The potion is a deep 
crimson color with a thick consistency that vibrates 
softly within its bottle, sending ripples along its surface. 
It smells and tastes of freshly ground pepper, hot spices, 
and faintly sour tomato juice. Due to its magical nature, 
the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as 
much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
Drinking additional 
bloody mariliths
 before you finish 
a long rest leaves your body feeling worn. When the 
potion’s effect ends, you can’t move or take actions until 
after your next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over 
you.
The following 
bloody marilith
 is a very rare variant 
with more powerful properties. It uses blood from a 
fiendish marilith, instead of a magical substitute, and 
pleasantly burns your tongue when drinking it. It also 
tastes better.
When you drink this potion, you can take one reaction 
on every turn in a combat for 1 minute. Unlike its 
common variant, this potion’s effect does not end when 
you use an additional reaction.
“The skeletal remains were cradling a similar skeletal 
sword. Its edges, abrasive and stained from long-dried 
blood, seemed to match some of the markings left on the 
figure holding it. Beneath the blade was a badly faded 
manuscript. It was seemingly hand written, and repeated 
like a mantra:
Embrace Self-Sacrifice. To forget the familiar as a price 
for greatness is admirable.
Conquer your Limits. To become more powerful is to 
embrace the purpose of life.
Enforce your Will. To conquer all obstacles in your path 
is to ensure success.
The lines kept repeating, even off the bottom of the page. 
Whoever, or whatever, this was, they had had a serious 
conviction.”
—From the diary of Garold, the soldier.
"
Bonfire Charm,"Wondrous item, common
This fiery glass sculpture is 4 inches tall and has a 
small, magical ember inside. When placed on a burning 
campfire or torch, the charm and ember enchant the 
fire with a faint, healing radiance. If you or any friendly 
creatures within the fire’s light regain hit points at the 
end of a short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, 
each of those creatures treats a Hit Die roll of 1 as a 2.
"
Book of Clothier’s Croquis,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This magic book has only the basic outline of a 
humanoid drawn on each of its pages. When found, the 
book has 2d6 + 8 remaining pages inside. If you spend 
at least 10 minutes drawing a detailed set of clothes on 
the outlined humanoid, the page becomes charged with 
magic. A creature holding a torn-out sheet of charged 
paper can use its action to speak the book’s command 
phrase, causing the drawn clothes to either magically 
appear on its body or transform any similar, overlapping 
garment it’s already wearing to match the new 
appearance. The sheet of paper then turns to dust and is 
destroyed. If the creature isn’t humanoid, the clothes fit 
as best they can as determined by the GM.
A transformed garment loses any magical or 
nonmagical property it may have until it returns to 
its normal form, unless that garment’s function is 
completely unchanged by the new appearance. For 
example, a set of plate armor that’s transformed into a 
leather vest would no longer grant any benefit to AC, but 
a chain shirt that’s been transformed to match the ones 
worn by the royal guard still would.
The drawn clothes and transformed garments remain 
for up to 4 hours but magically disappear or return to 
their normal form if you remove them or use an action 
to speak the command phrase again. The drawn clothes 
are physical but offer no benefits to AC. Although the 
drawn clothes and transformed garments can duplicate 
the appearance of other magic clothes, they don’t gain 
their magical properties.
"
Book of Instant Copying,"Wondrous item, common
This book has a glass cover and is typically found with 
2d10 + 30 blank pages. As an action, you can place 
a piece of paper or similar object (such as a leaf or 
patterned fabric) between the book’s glass and the page 
below it and speak the book’s command word. When you 
do, the book magically inscribes an image of the placed 
object in black ink as it appears pressed against the 
glass on the first blank page of the book.
Copied magic scrolls or spellbooks appear as 
nonsensical glyphs when copied in this way. When the 
last page of the book has been used, you can rebind it 
with 50 blank new pages using 50 gp of fine materials 
and 8 hours of work.
"
Bounder’s Ball,"Wondrous item, rare
This enchanted strip of metal is bound to a friendly 
spirit, which emits a faint glow and seems to vibrate 
with excitement when held. When you throw this item, a 
playful animal spirit appears beside you and chases after 
it. Immediately after you throw it, the spirit returns the 
ball to you.
You can attach the 
bounder’s ball
 to the base of 
a weapon that does not have the heavy property by 
pressing it against the weapon for at least 10 minutes. 
Once you do, you can use a bonus action to speak the 
ball’s command word to cause the weapon to shed bright 
light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 
10 feet. Speaking the command word again or stowing 
the weapon puts out the light. When you make a ranged 
attack with the glowing weapon, the ball’s animal spirit 
appears and happily retrieves it. Immediately after the 
attack, the spirit returns the weapon to your hand or 
drops it at your feet (your choice).
You can remove the ball from the weapon over the 
course of a short rest by gently tugging at it, as if from 
an animal’s mouth. The spirit is ethereal and doesn’t 
occupy any space. If you have a 
companion’s band[1]
, 
the spirit can interact with the one created by the band.
"
Bow of the Cobra,"Weapon (any bow), rare (requires attunement)
This metallic bow resembles the shape of a mighty 
cobra and is covered in spots of patina. When you fire an 
arrow from the bow, you can choose to coat the arrow 
in a thin layer of acid. A target hit with the acid-coated 
arrow takes an extra 1d4 acid damage. Hit or miss, a 
nonmagical coated arrow is destroyed after the attack.
In addition, the bow has 4 charges and regains 1d4 
expended charges daily at dawn. When you take the 
Attack action using this bow, you can expend 1 of its 
charges to replace one of your weapon attacks with a 
special attack. This special attack duplicates the effect 
of the 
acid arrow
 spell and uses the same attack bonus 
as your normal weapon attacks with the bow.
"
Bow of the Eldritch Archer,"Weapon (shortbow), rare (requires attunement)
This unearthly bow is disjointed and gruesome. It’s 
made of an ashen, twisted wood that acts as a conduit 
for eldritch energy and has a series of fleshy tendril-
like growths that bulge through the wood’s grain. 
Arrows shot from this bow are destroyed once they’re 
fired, turning into a projectile of pure energy instead. 
This projectile deals 1d10 force damage, instead of 
the arrow’s normal damage, and retains any magical 
properties of the destroyed arrow. Hit or miss, a 
projectile is lost after the attack.
These energy projectiles can sometimes pierce 
enemies. Once on each of your turns when you make an 
attack using this weapon, you can force another creature 
10 feet directly behind the original target to make a DC 
15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature 
takes 1d10 force damage.
"
Bow of the Spelldrinker,"Weapon (any bow), very rare (requires attunement)
This gilded bow creates hazy illusions of the cosmos 
when drawn. Attacks made with this magic bow deal an 
extra 1d4 force damage to any target hit by it.
When you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet 
of you while holding this bow, you can use your reaction 
to draw from your own life force and attempt to counter 
it. When you do, you take 30 force damage, which can't 
be reduced or prevented in any way, and fire a magical 
arrow of pure force from the bow toward the creature. 
If the creature is casting a spell of 5th level or lower, its 
spell fails and has no effect. In addition, the target must 
make a DC 16 saving throw, using its spellcasting ability. 
On a failed save, the creature takes 30 force damage as 
the magic is ripped from it. On a successful save, the 
creature takes half as much force damage. Once this 
property has been used, it can’t be used again until you 
finish a short or long rest.
"
Bow of the Twilight Valkyrie,"Weapon (any bow), rare (requires attunement)
This bow balances the positive and negative magics 
from the upper and lower planes of existence. Once on 
each of your turns when you make an attack with the 
bow as part of the Attack action, you can channel either 
positive or negative energy into the attack. When you do, 
you take a –5 penalty to the attack roll. If you channeled 
positive energy into the attack and hit, the target takes 
an extra 2d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll 
made against it by a creature other than you before the 
start of your next turn has advantage. If you channeled 
negative energy into the attack, the target takes an 
extra 2d6 necrotic damage, and the next attack roll 
the target makes before the end of your next turn has 
disadvantage.
The balance of good and evil, of right and wrong, is always 
a great challenge. Without light there is no shadow, yet we 
can only see the stars when it’s at its darkest.
"
Bracers of the Iron Octopus,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
These iron bracers are ornamented with an embossed 
octopus and tentacle designs. While wearing the 
bracers, you gain a +5 bonus on ability checks and 
saving throws to resist and escape from being grappled.
In addition, you can use an action to speak the 
bracers’ command word. When you do, the bracers’ iron 
and leather twist and writhe, falling off your arms. The 
bracers become a giant octopus at a point within 10 feet 
of you under your control that acts on its own initiative 
count. By using a bonus action to speak the command 
word again, you return the bracers to their normal form 
in a space formerly occupied by the octopus.
This octopus is made of leather and iron, is a 
construct instead of a beast, and has a +2 bonus to 
its AC. On your turn, you can mentally command the 
octopus if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren’t 
incapacitated. You decide what action the octopus takes 
and where it moves during its next turn, or you issue it 
a general command, such as to attack your enemies or 
guard a location.
If the octopus is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and 
reverts to its bracer form. The bracers then shatter and 
are destroyed. If the octopus reverts to bracer form 
before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.
"
Bramble Buckler,"Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement by a druid 
or ranger)
This twisting mass of tightly knotted thorns forms 
a functional buckler. Its thorny limbs move ever so 
slightly to defend against incoming attacks that might 
otherwise pierce it. When you don the shield, the vines 
grow harmlessly around the arm and hand that’s holding 
it, preventing it from being unwillingly dropped or 
disarmed.
As an action, you can speak the shield’s command 
word and touch it to the ground at a point at your feet. 
When you do, you doff the shield as the vines release 
from your arm and rapidly grow across the ground, 
creating a visible line of thorns and brambles 20 feet 
long and 15 feet wide. The thorns recreate the effects 
of the 
spike growth
 spell within that area, without 
requiring concentration, and last for the spell’s duration. 
When it ends, the thorns coalesce back into the twisted 
shield. You can speak the shield’s command word again 
as an action while you’re within 5 feet of the thorny area 
to end the effect early, causing the vines to regrow onto 
your arm as you don the shield again. Once this property 
of the shield has been used, it can’t be used again until 
the next dawn.
"
Brawler’s Ring,"Ring, uncommon
This brass ring has several splits in its metal that are 
filled with seams of jade. While wearing this ring, your 
unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 
+ your Strength modifier on a hit.
"
Brutal Macuahuitl,"Weapon (longsword), uncommon
This tribal sword’s sturdy wooden frame is lined with 
obsidian shards, allowing attacks made with it to deal 
either bludgeoning or slashing damage (your choice). 
In addition, the sword has been enchanted through 
numerous blood rituals by war priests. When you roll a 
20 on your attack roll with this magic weapon against 
a creature, that creature becomes marked for death 
until the start of your next turn. A marked creature can’t 
regain hit points, and when the mark ends, that creature 
takes 1d8 necrotic damage.
"
Bulette Bulwark,"Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement)
This leather-wrapped shield was made from the 
armored body of a bulette and still retains some of its 
natural properties. While holding this shield, you have a 
+1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s 
normal bonus to AC.
In addition, the shield has 3 charges and regains 
1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding 
the shield, you can use a bonus action to speak the 
shield’s command word and expend 1 of its charges. 
When you do, you gain tremorsense out to a range of 30 
feet. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate (as if 
concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute, or 
until you drop or stow the shield.
"
Bulette Torpedo,"Weapon (javelin), very rare (requires attunement)
This javelin is protected by a tough carapace wrought 
from a slain bulette and can burrow through dirt and 
unworked stone in order to reach its mark. You gain 
a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this 
magic weapon.
When you make a ranged attack with this javelin, 
you can throw it into the ground instead. When you do, 
you can target either a creature you can see or space 
on the ground within the weapon’s range. The space 
can be a place you can see or one you can describe by 
stating the distance and direction the javelin would 
travel through the ground to reach it, such as “100 feet 
northwest” or “30 feet straight downward.” The javelin 
effortlessly burrows through the ground (if able) to reach 
the target of the attack, stabbing through the ground 
at its destination. After the attack, it burrows back to 
your location, jumping out of the ground and back into 
your hand. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made 
in this way, the target of the attack takes an extra 1d6 
bludgeoning damage and 1d6 slashing damage as 
the weapon viciously erupts from the ground, and if 
the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must also 
succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw 
(target’s choice) or be knocked prone. Attacking a prone 
creature with this weapon doesn’t impose disadvantage 
on your ranged attack rolls.
"
Bullfrog Totem,"Wondrous item, common
The magical fey spirit of a bullfrog inhabits this moss-
covered stone statue. A creature that can see invisible 
objects can see this spirit swimming through the air 
around the statue. The statue is 9 inches tall and weighs 
3 pounds. Harmless, mundane insects such as flies, 
gnats, and mosquitos are magically repelled from the 
statue in a 30-foot-radius sphere that remains centered 
on it.

teaching your players the quick-to-play dice  
game “Bulette Takes the Liar” on page 272.
The brambles in the Grymclover forest were twisting. 
Moving. Writhing. And then they were gone. In their place 
stood a druid caressing the thorns like a long lost friend.
"
Burrage’s Collegiate Case,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This lute case is made from a rich, dark wood and 
is decorated with 33 mithral stars along its lid, 
with its largest star along the top. The case has five 
compartments. Four of the case’s compartments connect 
to an extradimensional space that allows it to hold 
numerous items while never weighing more than 7 
pounds. You choose which compartment you access by 
holding one of the large star’s five points whenever you 
open the lid. The smallest compartment can hold up 
to 7 flutes or similar small instruments. The midsize 
compartment holds up to 3 large instruments, such as 
a bagpipe, drum, or dulcimer. The largest compartment 
holds up to 4 small stools and a music stand. The fourth 
compartment doesn’t have a defined size, but can hold 
and categorize up to 60 sheets of written music. If you 
don’t choose a compartment, the case automatically 
opens to the fifth one, which doesn’t connect to an 
extradimensional space. The fifth compartment has 
enough room to hold a lute inside it.
Retrieving an item from the case requires an action. 
If you place something other than an instrument or 
musical object within one of the case’s extradimensional 
compartments, it magically appears next to the case 
again when you close the lid.
"
Caduceus Flail,"Weapon (flail), rare (requires attunement by a cleric or 
paladin)
This holy flail serves as a conduit for divine warriors 
and pulses with holy light, allowing you to fend off evil 
while protecting the wounded. You gain a +1 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 
While holding the flail, you can use a bonus action to 
speak the weapon’s command word to cause it to glow, 
shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light 
for an additional 10 feet. The light lasts until you use a 
bonus action to speak the command word again or until 
you drop or stow the flail. When you hit an undead with 
the glowing flail, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant 
damage.
When you use your Channel Divinity while holding 
the glowing flail, hostile creatures in the weapon’s 
bright light take radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your 
spellcasting modifier, and friendly creatures in the 
bright light regain hit points equal to the same amount. 
This damage is dealt before any other effects from your 
Channel Divinity. In addition, if your Channel Divinity 
forces a creature to make a saving throw, any undead in 
the flail’s bright light that fail the saving throw are also 
blinded until the end of your next turn.
"
Camilla’s Quicksilver Mirror,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This hand mirror is roughly 1 foot tall and weighs 1 
pound. While gazing into its reflective surface, you see 
a version of yourself that’s ever-so-slightly different. For 
example, your legs may bend the opposite direction, 
your eyes may be pitch black, or your reflection simply 
takes a moment to match whatever it is you’re doing. If 
you look at your reflection in the mirror while holding it 
and aren’t attuned to the mirror, you are forced to make 
a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you 
are frightened of the mirror, are unable to look away 
from or let go of it, and your speed becomes 0 for the 
duration. You can repeat this saving throw at the start of 
each of your turns or whenever you take damage while 
frightened in this way, ending the effect on a success. 
If you can’t see the mirror, you have advantage on the 
saving throw. On a successful save, you are immune to 
this effect for 24 hours.
While attuned to the mirror, you can use an action 
to hold it out and force another creature within 30 feet 
of you that can see you to see its own reflection. That 
creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving 
throw or suffer from one of the following effects (your 
choice):
"
Camper’s Crutch,"Weapon (mace), common
This enchanted fire poker is a favorite among travelers. 
Attacks made with this magic weapon deal either 
bludgeoning or piercing damage (your choice). In 
addition, as an action, you can use the poker to touch 
a pile of dry wood or other flammable object that isn’t 
being worn or carried and speak the weapon’s command 
word. When you do, the object catches fire and slowly 
begins to burn. Once this property has been used, it 
can’t be used again until the next dusk.
"
Camper’s Respite,"Rod, uncommon
This rod weighs 3 pounds and has an iron brazier at its 
top and spike at its base. You can use a bonus action 
while holding the rod to speak its first command word 
and create a magical flame at its top. While lit, this rod 
functions as a burning torch. You can use a bonus action 
to speak its command word again to extinguish the 
flame.
You can use an action to place the rod’s brazier upside 
down on the ground in an unoccupied space and speak 
its second command word. When you do, the spike at 
the rod’s other end begins to glow from within, revealing 
its subtle design as a tent. Over the course of 1 minute, 
the rod expands and magically unfurls a canvas from 
its top, creating a 5-foot-square opaque tent in its space 
with an entrance large enough for a Medium or smaller 
creature to comfortably fit. You choose the style, color, 
and quality of the tent each time you use this property. 
Regardless of its appearance, the tent can’t be anything 
but a tent.
Inside the tent is a square extradimensional dwelling, 
15 feet on a side and 10 feet high, with the enlarged 
camper’s respite
 supporting it at its center. The walls 
and ceiling are made of the same canvas as the tent, but 
the floor is made of smooth stone. The rod’s enlarged 
brazier functions as a magical fireplace that can be lit or 
extinguished by speaking the rod’s first command word. 
This fire gives off light and heat like a normal fire, but 
doesn’t require oxygen or create smoke. The atmosphere 
inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of 
the weather outside.
The tent is immobile and remains for up to 12 hours, 
until you use an action to speak its second command 
word again to dismiss it, or until the tent collapses. 
Dealing 20 damage to the tent (AC 13) causes it to 
collapse. The tent is immune to poison and psychic dam-
age. The tent reverts to a rod at the end of its duration, 
and anything inside the tent is forced into the nearest 
unoccupied space. When the tent becomes a rod again, 
this property of the rod can’t be used again for 12 hours.
"
Candleflame Bow,"Weapon (any bow or crossbow), uncommon (requires 
attunement)
Wrought from metal in the likeness of a brazier, this 
ranged weapon’s grip has been covered in wax and has 
a simple candle positioned in front of where the arrow 
or bolt is fired from. The candle is magic and never runs 
out of wax, nor can it be removed from the weapon. You 
can use a bonus action to speak the weapon’s command 
word to cause the candle to light itself, shedding light 
like a normal candle while ablaze. While the candle 
is lit, this magic weapon deals an extra 2 fire damage 
to any target it hits with a ranged attack. The candle’s 
flame lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the 
command word again or until you drop or stow the 
weapon.
If you roll the same number on both d20s when 
you make a ranged attack roll with advantage or 
disadvantage using this weapon while its candle is lit, 
the ammunition becomes wreathed in a conflagration 
of uncontrollable flames. The arrow or bolt flies toward 
the target and explodes, destroying the ammunition and 
dealing 4d6 fire damage to the target (instead of the 
attack’s normal damage), or half as much damage if the 
total of the attack roll was less than the target’s AC. This 
fire ignites flammable objects within 5 feet of the target 
that aren’t being worn or carried. This property can’t be 
used again until the next dawn.
"
Candleflame Helm,"Wondrous item, common
While wearing this helm, you can use a bonus action to 
mentally create a tiny flame just above your head. The 
flame sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light 
for an additional 15 feet. While the flame persists, you 
can use an action to mentally expand or reduce its radi-
us of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum 
of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. The flame 
remains until you use a bonus action to extinguish it, 
until you remove the helm, or you’re incapacitated.
"
Candy Xorn,"Wondrous item, common
Candy xorn
 is a round, waxy candy that typically 
comes in small bags of 2d6 + 3 pieces. Each piece is 
traditionally either orange or yellow, but always has 
a narrow, reptilian pupil drawn at its center. Eating a 
candy xorn
 causes your eyes to turn orange or yellow 
(your choice), and your pupils to match the ones found 
on the piece of candy. After 1 minute, the effect ends and 
your eyes return to normal.
In addition, each piece of 
candy xorn
 has a 5 percent 
chance to not be candy at all, but actually a gemstone 
covered in the sugared coating. When you find a 
gemstone in this way, it can be either eye agate (40%, 10 
gp), tiger’s eye (40%, 10 gp), or amber (20%, 100 gp).
"
Canister of Vreyval’s Soothing Tea,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This small metal canister contains 2d4 + 2 bags of 
magical tea when found. You can steep a bag of tea 
for 1 minute in a cup of boiling water to transform the 
water into a rich, flavorful tea that calms the nerves 
and revitalizes the spirit. When you drink a cup of the 
hot tea, you regain 1d6 + 2 hit points and gain the 
same amount as temporary hit points. In addition, 
any effect causing you to be charmed or frightened is 
suppressed for 1 hour, after which any suppressed effect 
resumes, provided that its duration hasn’t expired in the 
meantime.
You can drink the tea using an action, although it’s 
most commonly finished over the course of at least 1 
minute. If the tea has been left to cool before you drink 
it, you regain only half the amount of hit points and tem-
porary hit points, and no other effects are suppressed.
"
Captain’s Pride,"Armor (leather or studded leather), rare (requires 
attunement)
This well-crafted leather armor comes with a sturdy, 
enveloping longcoat, bearing on its back the insignia of a 
well-known pirate captain. When you attune to it, the in-
signia changes to one that represents you instead. While 
wearing this armor, climbing and swimming don’t cost 
you extra movement, and you can breathe underwater.
In addition, you can use a bonus action to shift into a 
watery, elemental form, gaining the following benefits 
for the duration:
 
y
 Your speed increases by 10 feet.
 
y
 You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and 
slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, as well 
as resistance to acid damage.
 
y
 You have advantage on ability checks to avoid 
or escape being grappled or restrained. If you’re 
already grappled or restrained when you shift into 
this form, you automatically escape.
 
y
 While you’re underwater, Wisdom (Perception) 
checks made to see you have disadvantage.
This form lasts as long as you concentrate (as if 
concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute. 
Once this property of the armor has been used, it can’t 
be used again until the next dawn.
"
Carrion Shroud,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This ruffled cloak of dull feathers and down grants you 
the resilience and cunning of a ravenous vulture. When 
you move while wearing this cloak, small, tattered 
feathers drift from the cloak that vanish when they touch 
the ground. While wearing the cloak, your Constitution 
score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, you have 
advantage on saving throws against disease and poison, 
and you have resistance to poison damage.
In addition, while wearing the cloak, you can speak its 
command word as a bonus action to cause it to trans-
form into a pair of sickly vulture wings for 1 minute. 
While the cloak is transformed, you gain a flying speed 
of 60 feet, and when you hit a creature that’s missing 
any of its hit points with a melee weapon attack, that 
creature takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage. This prop-
erty of the cloak can’t be used again until the next dusk.
Curse.
 This cloak is cursed, and becoming attuned to 
it extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the 
remove curse
 spell. As long as you remain cursed, you 
are unwilling to part with the cloak, keeping it worn at 
all times. The cloak gives you an insatiable hunger for 
flesh, and while traditional food can sustain you, you 
no longer enjoy the smell or taste of it. While cursed, 
whenever you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you 
to 0 hit points, you’re forced to make a DC 13 Wisdom 
saving throw. If the creature is a construct, ooze, plant, 
or undead, you automatically succeed on this saving 
throw. On a failed save, you are overcome with the urge 
to tear into the creature’s flesh and feast: sacrificing any 
additional movement, action, or bonus action you had 
left on your turn. You can repeat this saving throw at the 
start of each of your following turns, ending your need to 
feast on a success.
"
Celestial Sunrise,"Potion, common or uncommon
The typical 
celestial sunrise
, a common potion, is a 
specialty alcoholic beverage that causes light to pour 
from your mouth for 1 hour after you drink it. The light 
shines in a cone from your mouth, casting bright light 
for 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The 
potion glows softly on its own, even if no light is shining 
through it. The beverage is rejuvenating and powerfully 
flavored with pineapple, orange, and honey, with just a 
hint of pomegranate as an aftertaste. Due to its magical 
nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature 
twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical 
beverage.
The following 
celestial sunrise
 is an uncommon 
variant with additional properties. It also tastes better.
When you drink this potion, you can see normally in 
darkness, both magical and nonmagical, for the next 8 
hours. In addition, the light cast from your mouth due 
to the potion’s common effects increases, casting bright 
light out to 40 feet and dim light for an additional 40 
feet instead.
"
Chain Devil Gloves,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
These leather gloves are fashioned from the hands 
of a slain chain devil. While wearing these gloves, an 
ethereal chain attaches itself to any weapon you throw 
that has the thrown property. The chain has a reach of 
60 feet and breaks its connection to the weapon if the 
weapon is held by a creature or if you are ever more 
than 60 feet away from it. You can have up to 4 of these 
chains at any time.
As an action, you can cause these chains to suddenly 
retract and pull any attached weapons with them. 
Any creature within the path of one or more of these 
weapons must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On 
a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to the 
damage die of the thrown weapon. A solid object or wall 
blocks the path of the retracted chain and weapon.
A retracted weapon lands harmlessly at your feet or in 
an open hand once it reaches you.
"
Champion’s Greatbow,"Weapon (longbow), rare
This large bow is wrought from the boughs of an old, 
resilient tree. Its wooden frame is exceptionally sturdy 
but difficult to draw. You must have a Strength score of 
13 or higher to wield this bow. This bow’s damage die 
is a d10, and when you make a ranged attack with this 
bow, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
Once on each of your turns when you make a ranged 
attack with this weapon, you can use the bow to fire a 
javelin or spear, instead of an arrow, without affecting 
the bow’s damage die. When you do, the bow’s normal 
and long ranges are halved for the attack. If the attack 
hits, the target takes extra piercing damage equal to 
your Strength modifier.
"
Charged Rapier,"Weapon (rapier), very rare (requires attunement)
This blade snaps and crackles with electrical power 
as it’s waved through the air. While holding the rapier, 
you have resistance to lightning damage. You gain a +1 
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic 
weapon, and it deals an extra 1d4 lightning damage to 
any target it hits.
Electric Charge.
 If you are proficient with this 
weapon, when you move at least 20 feet in a straight 
line on your turn while holding this rapier, you can 
speak its command word as a bonus action to briefly 
disappear and transform into a bolt of lightning. When 
you do, choose an unoccupied space you can see within 
20 feet of you that’s along the same straight line and in 
the same direction in which you’re moving. You form a 
5-foot-wide line of lightning originating from yourself 
that extends to the unoccupied space. You reappear 
in that space as the bolt of lightning passes through 
anything in its path.
If there are any creatures in the line of lightning, roll a 
d20 and add 9 to the roll. If the total of the roll meets or 
exceeds the AC of any creature in the line, that creature 
takes 1d4 + 1 lightning damage as you pierce through it 
as the bolt of lightning.
"
Chi-Balancing Tea,"Potion, rare
This potion is specially brewed by the monks of Durhe-
im using a unique leaf found only in their gardens. The 
tea remains magically warm while inside its traditional 
porcelain bottle. The potion’s flavor is deep and smoky, 
and leaves a sour aftertaste like the air after a storm.
When you drink this potion, it cures any short-term 
madness afflicting you, and if you are charmed or 
frightened, it ends those conditions. In addition, if you 
have 2 or more levels in the monk class, you regain 1d4 
+ 1 expended ki points.
"
Chimeric Collar,"Wondrous item, rare
This magic collar has three sections of sculpted 
metal bound by a strip of leather, with each section 
representing the head of a dragon, lion, and ram. You 
can place the collar on a willing Medium or smaller 
creature using an action. If the creature is a friendly 
beast companion or familiar (such as one summoned 
by the 
find familiar
 spell), you can speak the collar’s 
command word as part of this action to create a magical 
bond between you and the creature. The bond remains 
until the collar is removed.
You can use a bonus action to speak the collar’s 
command word while you can see the bonded creature 
within 30 feet of you. When you do, the creature grows 
in size to become Large, provided there’s enough space. 
When it becomes enlarged, the creature gains 2d10 + 4 
temporary hit points, can understand Draconic (but can’t 
speak it), and magically grows a second, identical head 
next to its own that lasts for the duration of the effect. 
Whenever the enlarged creature takes the Attack action, 
it can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack 
action instead if it has that action. The creature remains 
enlarged for up to 1 minute, until it drops to 0 hit points, 
or until you end the effect using a bonus action. Once 
this property of the collar has been used, it can’t be used 
again until the next dawn.
If the beast or familiar wearing the collar is a 
transformed humanoid or other creature, such as by the 
polymorph
 spell or similar magic, the bond fails when 
you speak the command word and the collar has no 
effect. If the bonded creature is a familiar summoned 
by the 
find familiar
 spell, the collar and familiar 
disappear into a pocket dimension together whenever 
you temporarily dismiss it. If the bonded familiar is 
dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves the 
collar behind. A creature can only gain the benefits of 
one magical collar at a time.
"
Chromatic Obsidian Greataxe,"Weapon (greataxe), rare (requires attunement)
This prismatic greataxe is made using chromatic 
obsidian, a dazzling type of stone found where several 
Elemental Planes meet. You gain a +1 bonus to attack 
and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When 
you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this magic 
weapon, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw. A target takes 1d6 cold damage, 1d6 fire 
damage, 1d6 lightning damage, and 1d6 radiant damage 
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. Roll the damage dice separately, recording any 6 
you roll. For each 6 you roll in this way, use the table 
below to determine which of the following effects apply.
Damage 
Type
Effect
Cold
The target’s speed is halved until the end of 
your next turn.
Fire
The target takes an extra 6 fire damage at 
the end of its next turn.
Lightning
The target can’t take reactions until the end 
of your next turn.
Radiant
The next attack roll made against the 
target before the end of your next turn has 
advantage.
"
Chronal Sphere,"Wondrous item, very rare
This brass sphere is roughly fist-sized and weighs 
1 pound. It vibrates gently while you hold it as tiny 
mechanisms whir inside. While holding the sphere, you 
can use a bonus action to speak its command word, 
causing spectral clock hands to appear on its curved 
surface and indicate the current time. The hands 
remain on the surface of the sphere until you speak the 
command word again. This property only functions on 
the Material Plane.
Spells.
 While holding the sphere, you can use an 
action to cast either the 
haste
 or 
slow
 spell (save DC 18, 
no concentration required) from it. Once the sphere has 
been used to cast a spell in this way, it can’t be used to 
cast that spell again. When the sphere has been used to 
cast both of these spells, it loses this property.
"
Chronomancer’s Eyepiece,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This singular lens lets you faintly see and command the 
flow of time around a target. The eyepiece has 5 charges 
and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. 
While wearing the eyepiece, you can expend 1 charge as 
a reaction at the end of another creature’s turn to speak 
either of the eyepiece’s two command words to warp the 
flow of time around that creature. You must be able to 
see the target, and it must be within 60 feet of you.
Past.
 If the target is willing, it is teleported back to 
the space it was at the beginning of its turn. If another 
creature or object is occupying the space, the target 
is teleported to nearest unoccupied space instead. An 
unwilling target must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma 
saving throw or be teleported in this way against its will.
Future.
 If the target is willing, it can immediately 
choose to move again, up to half its speed, without 
provoking opportunity attacks. After a target moves in 
this way, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.
"
Circlet of the Sharpened Mind,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a creature 
with an Intelligence score of 17 or higher)
This iron circlet has a magical pearl at its center and 
can hold up to 4 gemstones. When found, the circlet has 
2 gemstones. A gemstone worth at least 5,000 gp can be 
added to the circlet over the course of 1 minute as it’s 
magically drawn and fastened into place. While wearing 
the circlet, you can take a special Attack action on your 
turn to summon a number of floating, spectral swords 
equal to the number of gemstones in the circlet and 
make one melee spell attack with each of them against a 
target within 10 feet of you. You are proficient with these 
attacks and use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability 
for them. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal 
to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier. The swords appear 
at your side and remain there until you dismiss them as 
a bonus action or until you fall unconscious or remove 
the circlet. While the swords are summoned, you can 
take this special Attack action once on each of your 
turns. The spectral swords shed bright light in a 10-foot 
radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
"
Claymore of the Great Badger,"Weapon (greatsword), uncommon (requires attunement)
This weighty blade carries with it the strength of the 
mighty badger. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The sword 
has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily 
at dawn. When you hit a Large or smaller creature with 
this weapon, you can expend 1 charge from it to push 
that creature 5 feet away from you.
"
Cleaning Cube,"Wondrous item, common
This Tiny, sentient piece of an enchanted gelatinous 
cube is harmlessly soapy, instead of acidic, and enjoys 
cleaning the surfaces it travels across. When found, 
the 
cleaning cube
 is a dehydrated, 2-inch cube. While 
dehydrated, the cube is inanimate and its weight is 
negligible. You can place the dehydrated cube in 1 or 
more gallons of water as an action, causing it to animate 
and grow in size to become a 1-foot cube that weighs 
6 pounds. The rehydrated cube moves slowly while 
animated in this way, methodically cleaning objects and 
surfaces it comes into contact with. The cube remains 
hydrated for up to 8 hours, but can be squeezed as an 
action (as if it were a sponge) to dehydrate it again early.
The 
cleaning cube
 is considered a magical object and 
is not a creature. It has a speed of 1 foot and can climb 
difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, 
without needing to make an ability check. It has AC 10, 
10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. The cube 
dehydrates when it drops to 0 hit points, but regains all 
its hit points when hydrated again.
Sentience.
 The 
cleaning cube
 is a sentient unaligned 
item with an Intelligence of 1, a Wisdom of 6, and a 
Charisma of 1. It has hearing and blindsight out to a 
range of 60 feet. It can’t speak or read, but obeys your 
commands as best as it can understand them.
Personality.
 The 
cleaning cube
 is happiest finding 
and dissolving dirt and other grime, and enjoys the 
feeling of moving across clean, polished surfaces. 
It doesn’t concern itself with combat, preferring to 
continue its cleaning instead of involving itself in 
confrontation. If the cube finds a stray coin, gemstone, 
or other similar small item out of place while it cleans, 
it will absorb and clean the item until it’s removed by 
a creature as an action or until it becomes dehydrated 
once again.
"
Cloche of Surprise Treats,"Wondrous item, very rare
This magic silver cloche covers a large dinner platter. 
You can use an action to speak the cloche’s command 
word and remove it from the platter. When you do, use 
the table below to determine what kind of meal appears.
d12
Meal
1
A delicious meal appears on the platter large 
enough for one creature and provides as much 
nourishment as 1 day of rations.
2 – 5
A number of decadent, perfectly ripe mixed 
berries equal to twice the number rolled on the 
d12 appear on the platter. Eating one of these 
berries duplicates the effect of eating a berry 
from the 
goodberry
 spell. These berries remain 
potent for up to 10 days.
6 – 12
The cloche magically conjures a great feast, as 
if by the 
heroes’ feast
 spell. This version of the 
spell can feed a number of creatures equal to 
the number rolled on the d12.
Once the cloche has been used to conjure a meal in 
this way, it can’t be used again until a number of days 
have passed equal to the number rolled on the d12.
"
Clockwork Colony Toolbox,"Wondrous item, rare
This trim bronze toolbox rattles softly with the sound of 
bolts, screws, and other tools inside. The box weighs 3 
pounds and is 3 feet long, 1 foot wide, and 1 foot deep. 
Inside the toolbox are four empty, resizable bins with 
nothing inside. Any metal object left inside the closed 
toolbox for 1 hour becomes meticulously clean and 
polished.
Similarly, any small machine (such as a compass or 
hunting trap) left inside the closed toolbox for 1 hour is 
magically repaired. Any magical item with “clockwork” 
in its name regains all its hit points when left in the 
toolbox in this way. If the magical item has charges or 
additional magical properties, it regains 1d4 expended 
charges and the ability to use those properties again. 
Once an item or object has been restored in this way, it 
can’t be restored by the toolbox again for 24 hours.
"
Clockwork Earwig,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This 1-inch-long, copper mechanism magically coils 
around and clasps to the side of your ear, fitting as a 
functional ear cuff. It can be worn or removed using 
an action. When worn in this way, the mechanism can 
magically process any sound you hear, granting you the 
following benefits:
 
y
 You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
you make that rely on hearing.
 
y
 You can tap the earwig twice to record up to 1 
minute of sound, tapping it twice again to stop 
recording early. You can tap the earwig once 
to replay the recording in your ear, tapping it a 
second time to stop it early. Pressing and holding 
your finger to the earwig while it’s replaying the 
recording will pause the recording until you release 
your finger from it. Creating a new recording in this 
way erases any previous one stored.
 
y
  You can speak the earwig’s command word as an 
action to cast the 
comprehend languages
 spell from 
it. The spell ends early if you remove the earwig. 
This property of the earwig can’t be used again until 
the next dawn.
"
Clockwork Mend-A-Pillar,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This segmented mechanical caterpillar is 5 inches 
long, weighs 1 pound, and is made of copper. It has 
several tiny copper legs that give it a 5-foot walking 
speed. Within it are multiple containers filled with silk 
filaments, spools of thread, dyes, and an incredibly 
strong adhesive. Each of these materials is expelled 
through a tube in its mouth, and it is equipped with a 
transmutation lens in its head that allows it to change 
the adhesive to various kinds of wood, metal, stone, or 
crystal.
As an action, you can speak the caterpillar’s command 
phrase to cause it to repair a broken or torn object or 
area that it’s set upon. As long as the break or tear is 
no larger than 1 foot across in more than 1 dimension, 
the caterpillar can create the material to repair it. The 
caterpillar then begins crawling over and repairing the 
object or area, taking 10 minutes for every cubic foot 
it repairs (minimum of 1 minute). The caterpillar can 
physically repair a magic item or construct, but can’t 
restore magic to such an object. After the caterpillar 
finishes repairing an object or area, it stops moving and 
makes a soft chirping sound audible out to 30 feet. Once 
the caterpillar repairs 10 cubic feet of material, it can’t 
be used again until 24 hours have passed.
The caterpillar is considered a magical object and 
is not a creature. It has AC 10, 15 hit points, and has 
resistance to all damage types. If the 
mending
 spell is 
cast on the caterpillar while it has at least 1 hit point, it 
regains 2d6 hit points. If the caterpillar drops to 0 hit 
points, it can’t be used again for 24 hours, at which point 
it regains all its hit points.
"
Club of Dancing,"Weapon (club), uncommon (requires attunement)
This metallic club emits prismatic flashes of light 
whenever it hits a target. While you’re holding this 
weapon, you can use an action to cast the 
dancing lights
 
spell from it. In addition, the club has 3 charges and 
regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. When you 
hit with an attack using this weapon, you can expend 
1 of its charges to deal an extra 1d6 thunder damage. 
If the target is a creature, it must also make a DC 13 
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature’s 
speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn, and 
it spends its action on its next turn dancing in place: 
shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering.
"
Club of the Forest Drake,"Weapon (club), uncommon
This wooden club’s head has been naturally formed 
into the shape of a dragon’s maw. As an action, you can 
speak the club’s command word and strike the ground 
with it to cause a wave of thorns and thrashing vines to 
spring up from the ground in a 15-foot cone in front of 
you. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 
Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 slashing damage and 
be grappled by the thorns and vines for up to 1 minute. 
A grappled creature can use its action to make a DC 13 
Strength or Dexterity check, freeing itself on a success. 
At the end of each of its turns, a grappled creature takes 
1d6 piercing damage as it’s constricted by the thorny 
vines. Once this property of the club has been used, it 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Club of the Rook,"Weapon (club), uncommon
This club is a magic weapon and has a weighty stone 
tower at its end. While holding the weapon, you can 
use an action to move up to 30 feet in a line to an 
unoccupied space you can see on the ground, barreling 
through creatures no more than one size larger than you 
and objects that weigh no more than 400 pounds in the 
line. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks 
and ignores difficult terrain. Each target in the line you 
barrel through must make a DC 13 Strength saving 
throw. On a failed save, a target takes 3d4 bludgeoning 
damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, 
a target takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked 
prone. If a target in the line is a structure or is too large 
or heavy to barrel through, it automatically succeeds on 
the saving throw and your movement ends early. Your 
movement also ends early if you attempt to move over a 
space in which you normally can’t, such as over a gorge 
or up a wall.
The club’s property can’t be used again until the next 
dawn. In the meantime, the club can still be used as a 
magic weapon.
"
Coldfire Anvil,"Wondrous item, rare
This cold, iron anvil weighs 50 pounds and is 1 and 
a half feet long. It has three magic runes on its side 
from the Everglacier that magically enchant any item 
sharpened, forged, or otherwise smithed using this 
anvil. Over the course of a full workday, or half as long if 
you’re proficient with smith’s tools, you can use the anvil 
to turn a nonmagical metal weapon into a coldfire one. A 
coldfire weapon is magical and deals an extra 1d6 cold 
damage to any target it hits, but is made fragile like ice. 
When you make an attack roll using a coldfire weapon 
and roll a 1, roll a d20. On a 9 or lower, the weapon 
shatters and is destroyed, releasing a biting burst of icy 
air that deals 2d6 cold damage to all creatures within 10 
feet of the weapon. After 7 days, a coldfire weapon loses 
the enchantment and becomes nonmagical again.
Once the anvil has been used to enchant a weapon in 
this way, it can’t do so again for 1d6 + 1 days.
"
Comet Ballista,"Weapon (crossbow, heavy), rare (requires attunement)
This crossbow is partially covered in cold shards of 
stone and metal and uses sling bullets as ammunition 
instead of crossbow bolts. When you fire a sling bullet 
from this magic crossbow, it flashes with blue light and 
leaves behind a brief, glimmering trail of cold, sparkling 
dust. Ranged attacks with this weapon deal bludgeoning 
damage, instead of piercing damage, and any target 
hit by it takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. In addition, 
the first time you hit a target on each of your turns 
with a ranged attack using this weapon, each creature 
within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage.
Hailing Comets.
 You can use an action to fire the 
crossbow into the air and speak its command word, 
choosing a point that you can see within 120 feet of 
you when you do. The sling bullet scatters into icy dust 
and is destroyed, but magically conjures a barrage of 
miniscule falling comets above the point. The comets 
fall in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder centered on 
that point and disappear once they hit the ground. Each 
creature within the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 8d6 cold damage on a failed save, 
or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this 
property has been used, it can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
"
Conspirator’s Coat,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This magic longcoat is adorned with raven feathers 
and carved jet buttons. While wearing this coat, you 
have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks. In 
addition, the coat has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 
expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the coat, 
you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges 
to disappear, releasing up to three ravens from your 
location under your control that scatter into the air. 
Each raven has AC 12, 1 hit point, and can fly up to 
40 feet as part of this bonus action without provoking 
opportunity attacks. At the start of your next turn, the 
ravens vanish, and you reappear in the space of one of 
the ravens (your choice).
If all the ravens are reduced to 0 hit points, you 
reappear early in the same space as the last one that 
died. When you do, any excess damage dealt to the 
raven carries over to your normal form.
"
Contingency Band,"Ring, rare
Each of this leather ring’s three braided bands bears 
the design of a dark, winding serpent. You can use an 
action to submerge the ring in a 
potion of healing
 or 
similar healing draft. If the ring is left to sit in a potion 
for 1 minute in this way, the ring magically consumes 
it and any of its healing properties. For each potion the 
ring has consumed, one of its dark serpents glows with 
a faint red light. The ring can have up to 3 consumed 
potions at a time.
Immediately after you take damage while wearing the 
ring, you can use your reaction to speak its command 
word and gain the healing effects of one of the ring’s 
consumed potions (your choice). The consumed potion 
is then lost, and one of the ring’s serpents becomes dark 
once more.
"
Cottage Chest,"Wondrous item, rare
This 1-foot-long chest looks like a replica of a woodland 
cottage and is magically locked. You can use an action to 
place this chest on the ground and speak its command 
word. The chest immediately unlocks and grows into 
a cottage that remains until you use an action to speak 
the command word that dismisses it, which works only 
if the cottage is empty. When dismissed, the cottage 
returns to its normal chest form. If there isn’t enough 
space for the cottage or there are creatures in its area 
when you speak the command word, the chest remains 
locked and the action is wasted.
The cottage is a wooden, two-story building that’s 40 
feet wide and 65 feet long. Inside is a kitchen, a dining 
room, and a large parlor with an ever-burning fire in 
its hearth. A curling stairway leads to the second floor, 
which has 4 bedrooms equipped with furniture you’d 
find in a modest to respectable inn. The first floor has 
six windows, and each bedroom on the second floor has 
one. When activated, the cottage has a small door on the 
side facing you. The door opens only at your command, 
which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune 
to the 
knock
 spell and similar magic, such as that of a 
chime of opening
.
The cottage’s kitchen is filled with magical utensils 
that automatically stir, measure, and heat all manner 
of cuisine. Any check made using cook’s utensils within 
the cottage has advantage on the roll. When left to its 
own devices, the cottage magically produces an array 
of baked goods for up to 8 creatures when the cottage 
appears for the first time each day and again each day 
at dawn until it is dismissed. Eating the food within 
the cottage provides enough nourishment to sustain a 
creature for one day. If any baked goods are left uneaten, 
they vanish at dawn as the new goods appear. Any baked 
good, furniture, or similar object vanishes when taken 
outside the cottage and immediately reappears inside.
Further, fey and fiends can’t enter the cottage unless 
you choose to let them, and creatures can’t move or 
travel into it using teleportation or by extradimensional 
or interplanar means.
The cottage is made of wood and plaster, and its 
magic prevents it from being tipped over or moved. The 
roof, the door, and the walls (including the windows) 
each have 60 hit points, immunity to damage from 
nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and 
resistance to all other damage. Only a 
wish
 spell can 
repair the cottage (this use of the spell counts as 
replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of 
wish
 causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain all 
its hit points.
"
Courtesan’s Fanblade,"Weapon (dagger), uncommon (requires attunement)
This magic dagger is made of two hollow halves that can 
be opened with a flick of a small lever above its handle. 
Opening the dagger in this way reveals a beautiful paper 
fan that spreads out between the weapon’s two halves 
(no action required). While the fan is exposed, you can’t 
use this weapon to attack. You can close the fan and 
recombine the dagger’s halves again as a bonus action.
This dagger has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. While the fan is exposed, you can 
use an action to cover your face with it and expend 1 of 
its charges to cast the 
charm person
 spell (save DC 13) 
at 1st level. You can increase the spell slot level by one 
for each additional charge you expend.
"
Covolt Dagger,"Weapon (dagger), uncommon
This angular dagger is forged with covolt, an elemental 
blue metal that carries storm-like properties. When you 
score a critical hit against a target with an attack made 
with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d8 
lightning damage and can’t take reactions until the start 
of its next turn.
"
Covolt Scythe,"Weapon (glaive), rare (requires attunement)
This jagged scythe is forged with covolt, an elemental 
blue metal that carries storm-like properties. When you 
hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, 
it takes an extra 1d8 lightning damage. Once on each 
of your turns when you hit a creature with this weapon, 
you can choose a different creature within 10 feet of the 
target. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or take 1d8 lightning damage as an arc of 
electricity lashes out at it from the original target.
"
Crown of Storms,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This crown was created by storm giants as a reward 
for a brave band of much smaller adventurers. While 
wearing this crown, you have resistance to lightning 
and thunder damage. If you are subjected to an effect 
that deals lightning or thunder damage and allows you 
to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you 
instead take no lightning or thunder damage if you 
succeed on the saving throw. If you are a giant, you can 
choose to wear this crown as a ring, instead.
In addition, you can use a bonus action to take on the 
aspect of the stormbringer. When you do, you spark with 
electrical power and your eyes glow bright white. The 
aspect lasts for 1 minute or until you end it early using a 
bonus action. While the aspect persists, you gain a flying 
speed of 30 feet and can hover. For the duration, you 
also gain the following benefits:
 
y
 You can use an action to release a bolt of lightning 
at a point on the ground that you can see that’s 
within 60 feet of you and at least 15 feet below you. 
Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make 
a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 
4d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one.
 
y
 You can use an action to cast the 
thunderwave
 spell 
(2nd-level version, save DC 17). The first time you 
cast this spell each time you take on the aspect, it’s 
cast at 4th level instead.
 
y
 When an attacker within 30 feet hits you with a 
weapon attack, you can use your reaction to send 
out a bolt of lightning at the attacker. The attacker 
must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
1d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. Each time the 
attacker hits you again before the end of this turn, it 
must repeat the saving throw.
Once this property of the crown has been used, it can’t 
be used again until the next dawn.
"
Crown of the Mindmaster Matriarch,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)
This golden crown is inset with a powerful fire ruby 
and veiled with light, mithral chain. The crown’s 
descending prongs overlap with your temples and third 
eye, expanding your mind’s commanding reach. While 
wearing this crown, you can use an action to cast the 
telepathic bond
 spell from it.
In addition, while wearing the crown, you can use an 
action to cast the 
dominate person
 spell using your spell 
save DC from it. On a failed save, a creature is affected 
by the spell for the duration, and for the next 24 hours 
after the spell ends, you have advantage on Charisma 
checks you make to interact with it. These effects end 
early if you or an ally deals damage to the creature. If 
the target is connected to you through your telepathic 
bond, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to resist 
this spell’s effects when cast in this way. Once this 
property has been used, it can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
"
Cube of Teleportation,"Wondrous item, rare
This hefty, metal cube is about 6 inches on a side and 
weighs 3 pounds. One of the cube’s sides looks like a 
metallic stamp, and is made of countless interlocking 
and shifting panels that reconfigure themselves to 
magically generate a new, unique sigil sequence daily 
at dawn, as described in the 
teleportation circle
 spell. 
Its five other sides are flat and blank, or, at the GM’s 
discretion, have up to 5 different sigil sequences 
recorded onto them.
If you find a permanent teleportation circle, you can 
place and hold one of the cube’s flat sides against the 
circle for 1 hour, focusing on it for the duration (as if 
concentrating on a spell). If you hold and focus on the 
cube for the full duration, the circle’s sigil sequence is 
recorded onto the cube’s face. If a sigil was already on 
the cube’s face, it’s replaced by the new one.
The cube has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. If you hold one of the cube’s 
recorded sigil sequences on the ground face-down 
and focus on it for 1 minute (as if concentrating on a 
spell), the cube expends 1 of its charges and duplicates 
the effect of the 
teleportation circle
 spell, using the 
sigil sequence from the cube’s face to form the spell’s 
teleportation circle on the ground below it.
Alternatively, you can hold the stamp side of the 
cube on the ground and focus on it for 1 minute (as if 
concentrating on a spell). If you hold and focus on the 
cube for the full duration, it magically applies its unique 
sigil sequence onto the ground in a 10-foot-diameter 
teleportation circle, provided that there’s enough space 
to do so. This circle remains for 1 hour, and can only 
be used as a destination circle for the duration. Once 
this property has been used, it can’t be used again until 
the next dawn, unless you use an action to expend 1 of 
the cube’s charges to generate a new sigil sequence and 
regain the use of this property. Once you’ve placed a 
unique teleportation circle in this way, you can use this 
side of the cube as if it were a normal sigil sequence 
recording for the generated circle.
"
Cuff of Captions,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While wearing this platinum ear cuff, any audible 
sound or spoken language that you’re within earshot 
of is magically transcribed, appearing as unobtrusive, 
illusory text that only you can see in the corner of your 
vision. While wearing the cuff, you gain a +2 bonus 
to Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing, 
even if you’re deafened, as you can sometimes read the 
transcriptions of sounds that are otherwise inaudible. 
The transcriptions are written in Common, and vary in 
size and form depending on the nature of the sound. The 
text conveys the literal meaning of any spoken language 
that it transcribes, but can suggest similar Common 
idioms in place of the ones it translates from other 
languages. You can choose to ignore certain sounds and 
transcriptions, causing the text to vanish, in order to 
better focus on the ones you’re interested in.
"
Dagger of First Light,"Weapon (dagger), uncommon
You have advantage on initiative rolls while holding this 
weapon. If you’re first in the initiative order, your speed 
is increased by 15 feet for the first round of combat.
In addition, you can use a bonus action to speak the 
weapon’s command word to cause its blade to glow. 
The glowing weapon sheds bright light in a 20-foot 
radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While 
the weapon is glowing, it deals radiant damage instead 
of piercing. You can use a bonus action to speak the 
weapon’s command word again to cause its light to fade 
and return to normal.
"
Dark Mantle,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This leathery cloak is made from the remains of a 
darkmantle. While wearing it, climbing doesn’t cost you 
extra movement, and you have advantage on Strength 
(Athletics) check made to climb.
In addition, while wearing this cloak, you can use 
an action to speak its command word to emit an aura 
of magical darkness. This aura extends from you in a 
15 -foot radius, moves with you, and spreads around 
corners. The darkness lasts as long as you maintain 
concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 
minute. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this 
darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. If any 
of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by 
a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the 
light is dispelled. Once this property of the cloak has 
been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Davy Jones’s Key,"Weapon (trident), legendary (requires attunement)
This powerful trident is made of verdigris-covered 
bronze. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to 
+3 while you are underwater.
When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this 
weapon against a creature, that creature must succeed 
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or begin to 
suffocate. At the end of each of its turns, a creature 
suffocating in this way can repeat the saving throw. On 
a successful save or when it drops to 0 hit points, the 
creature can breathe again. A suffocating creature can’t 
speak. A creature is immune to this effect if it doesn’t 
need to breathe or has legendary actions.
Release the Kraken.
 You can use an action to speak 
the trident’s command word to open a 15-foot-radius 
eldritch gate centered on a point you can see on the 
ground within 60 feet of you, turning the ground in 
the area into difficult terrain. If you are underwater, 
the point doesn’t need to be on the ground. The gate is 
one-way. When the gate opens, up to 3 massive kraken 
tentacles appear through the gate, forcing any Large or 
smaller creature in the tentacle’s space into the nearest 
unoccupied space. Each tentacle is treated as a Large 
monstrosity with 60 hit points, AC 18, a reach of 30 
feet, immunity to all conditions, and a +7 bonus to all 
ability checks and saving throws. A tentacle can move 
anywhere within the gate’s area on your turn (no action 
required) without provoking opportunity attacks. You 
can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack 
with the tentacle. A tentacle remains until it falls to 0 hit 
points or the gate closes.
"
Dawn and Dusk,"Weapon (mace or sickle), rare
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon, which also has the light 
property. The weapon transforms at different times of 
the day. At dawn, the weapon’s form becomes a mace, 
whose head is ringed with a line of radiating spikes. 
At dusk, it becomes a sickle with star designs along its 
crescent edge. A target hit with the mace takes an extra 
1d4 radiant damage. A target hit with the sickle takes an 
extra 1d6 necrotic damage.
"
Death’s Shadow,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This black garnet amulet is carved into the shape of a 
bird’s skull and is adorned with several dark feathers. 
At its center is a single phoenix feather that serves as a 
catalyst for this strange talisman’s necromantic magic. 
While wearing this amulet, you are immune to necrotic 
damage.
Shadow Form.
 When you are reduced to 0 hit 
points while wearing this amulet, a shadowy version of 
yourself rises from your unconscious body. You control 
this form, which has your equipment and statistics. 
It has 100 temporary hit points and resistance to all 
damage that isn’t force, psychic, or radiant. The shadow 
form can’t move more than 60 feet from your body. 
The shadow vanishes after 1 minute or when it loses 
all its temporary hit points. If the shadow survives for 
the duration, it returns to your body and causes you 
to regain a number of hit points equal to the shadow’s 
remaining number of temporary hit points. If the 
shadow is defeated, the amulet is destroyed and you 
immediately fail 2 death saving throws.
While your shadow form is defending you, your 
unconscious body is covered by an impenetrable veil 
of shadow. While covered in this way, you can’t be 
interacted with: you are immune to all damage, don’t 
make death saving throws, can’t regain hit points, and 
can’t be affected by spells or magical effects. A creature 
can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, 
moving the covered body up to 10 feet on a success.
Once this property has been used, it can’t be used 
again until 7 days have passed.
"
Deathloop Watch,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This golden pocket watch has a skull-shaped lid with 
three panes of blue glass that cover its two eyes and 
nose. At the center of the watch is a secondary dial with 
a small, skeletal hand that indicates the amount of hit 
points you have remaining. If you die while the watch is 
on your person, the watch reverses your personal time 
stream just long enough to keep you alive, returning you 
to life with 1 hit point and allowing you to immediately 
stand up. When the watch reverses time in this way, 
one of the watch’s three glass panes cracks and can’t 
be repaired by mundane or magical means. For each 
pane of cracked glass, there is a cumulative 25 percent 
chance that the watch fails to reverse time when you die. 
When all three panes of glass are cracked, the watch 
becomes nonmagical, although it can still be used to tell 
the time.

"
Deathly Diadem,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This gruesome crown was worn by a powerful lich 
before falling into the hands of the adventurers who 
slayed it. While wearing this crown, you have resistance 
to necrotic damage, are always under the effects of the 
tongues
 spell, and you can cast the 
speak with dead
 
spell at will. When you cast 
speak with dead
 in this way, 
you can only ask the target 1 question, to which the 
target answers with either “yes,” “no,” or “maybe.” If the 
question can’t be answered in this way, the spell ends. In 
addition, while you wear this crown, undead creatures 
have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
Curse.
 This crown is cursed, a fact that is only 
revealed to you when you die. The first time that you 
die while attuned to this crown, its curse is extended to 
you, and you are immediately returned to life with 1 hit 
point. While cursed, your alignment becomes evil, if it 
isn’t already, and your utmost goal is to become an all-
powerful lich. While cursed, your creature type becomes 
undead, in addition to your other existing creature types.
A creature remains cursed in this way until targeted 
by a 
wish
 spell or divine intervention. Removing the 
crown fails to end the curse. While a cursed creature 
may not reveal that the diadem is cursed, its allies may 
be able to deduce its presence and effects based on the 
creature’s behavior.
"
Detective’s Notebook,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This worn notebook is filled with pages of scribbled 
notes, addendums, and sketches—many of which seem 
to be added by different sources. While holding the 
book, whenever you make an Intelligence (Investigation) 
or Wisdom (Insight) check, you gain a +1 bonus to 
the roll. If you spend at least 10 minutes investigating 
or interacting with the subject of these checks while 
writing notes in the book, you make the roll with 
advantage.
In addition, you can use an action to cast the 
comprehend languages
, 
detect thoughts
, or 
locate 
object
 spell from the book (save DC 13). Once the book 
has been used to cast one of these spells, it shouldn’t 
be used to cast a spell again in this way until the next 
dawn. Each time it is used again before then, the book 
has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and 
tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
"
Direstone Dwarven Key,"Weapon (handaxe), uncommon (requires attunement by a 
dwarf)
This dwarven handaxe is specially issued to guards 
of the Direstone mines, treasury, and prisons. You 
gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
this magic weapon. If it hits a stone object, the hit is 
automatically a critical hit.
In addition, you can use an action to speak the 
handaxe’s command word and strike a fixed stone 
surface with it, such as a wall or ceiling. If the surface 
is no more than 2 feet thick, it magically pulls apart to 
form a temporary doorway. The doorway is no more 
"
Direstone Runic Wand,"Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
A rigid stone wand used by the arcane dwarves of 
the Direstone mines. The wand has 7 charges. While 
holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of 
its charges to trace one of the following runes in the air 
to invoke its properties (spell save DC 15):
Algiz.
 You can expend 3 charges to grant 1 creature 
you can see within 10 feet of you resistance to fire 
damage for 1 hour.
Eihwaz.
 You can expend 2 charges to cast the 
arcane 
lock
 spell. When you use this spell to lock a second 
object, the spell ends on the first one.
Hagalaz.
 You can expend 2 charges to cast the 
shatter
 
spell.
Kenaz.
 You can expend 1 charge to cast the 
burning 
hands
 spell, or 2 charges to cast the 
heat metal
 spell.
Raidho.
 You can expend 4 charges to cast the 
stone 
shape
 spell. This version of the spell can alter the form 
of either stone or natural metal (such as iron or silver).
Alternatively, you can use the wand to cast the 
illusory 
script
 spell over the course of 1 minute by expending 1 
of its charges, but can only use it to write on stone or 
metal surfaces.
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. 
On a 1, the wand crumbles into stone dust. If you are 
not a dwarf when this happens, you must also succeed 
on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be petrified 
until freed by the 
greater restoration
 spell or similar 
magic.
"
Diviner’s Dice,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This set of three six-sided crystal dice is weakly 
connected to the tides of fate. You can roll these dice as 
an action and record the numbers rolled. Once rolled, 
you can’t record any other numbers in this way until 
the next dawn. While you have the dice on your person, 
you can use a reaction when you or a creature you can 
see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll or ability 
check to add or subtract one of the recorded numbers 
from the attack roll or ability check’s total. You can wait 
to use this reaction until after the creature rolls the d20, 
but must decide before the GM says whether the roll 
succeeds or fails. Each recorded number can only be 
used once. You lose any unused recorded numbers daily 
at dawn.
"
Djinn and Tonic,"Potion, common or rare
The typical 
djinn and tonic
, a common potion, is a 
specialty alcoholic beverage that causes a magical wind 
to tussle your hair, cloak, or other clothing dramatically 
for 1 hour after you drink it. A small mote of mist 
dances above the potion’s liquid and gently stirs it. The 
beverage is smooth, bubbly, and very refreshing with 
notes of juniper, elderberries, white peach, and lavender. 
Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion 
affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a 
nonmagical beverage.
The following 
djinn and tonic
 is a rare variant with 
additional properties. It also tastes better.
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the 
gaseous form
 spell for 10 minutes (no concentration 
required) or until you end it early using an action. When 
the effect ends, your form rematerializes in a rush of air, 
forcing all Large and smaller creatures within 30 feet of 
you to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed 
save, a creature is pushed 10 feet away from you and 
knocked prone.
"
Dominic’s Field Guide to Language,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This magical book is filled with strange, shifting writing. 
While holding the book, you can use an action to speak 
its command word followed by a language of your 
choice, causing the book’s pages to become filled with 
translations between Common and the language you 
chose. This property can’t be used again for 24 hours. 
When found, the book’s pages are filled with translations 
for a random language.
You can read the book over the course of 1 hour, 
which can be done during a short rest. When you finish 
reading, you can magically speak, read, and write the 
chosen language for 24 hours. Only one creature can 
read from the book at a time.
"
Doom Bloom,"Wondrous item, rare
This dark, velvety lotus has tiny pinpricks of starlight 
in its petals and releases lofting, magical pollen. Once 
picked, a 
doom bloom
 withers and is destroyed after 1d6 
+ 1 days. As an action, you can inhale the magical pollen 
from a picked flower and speak the name of a creature 
or location that’s on the same plane of existence as you, 
duplicating the effect of the 
scrying
 spell (save DC 15).
If the target of the effect fails the saving throw, the 
spell succeeds and the flower explodes into a burst of 
pollen and is destroyed. If the target succeeds on the 
saving throw, you instead witness hundreds of brief, 
painful visions until the start of your next turn that show 
you untold ways that you might die. When the visions 
end, you take 6d6 psychic damage, but the flower isn’t 
destroyed. Once this property of the flower has been 
used, it can’t be used again for 24 hours.
Doom blooms
 typically grow on their own, but can 
sometimes be found near others. When the flower dies 
or is destroyed, a new one grows after 1d6 + 1 days in 
the same place in which it last grew. If the flower was 
successfully used to duplicate the effect of the 
scrying
 
spell, the new flower grows at the location where the 
spell’s sensor first appeared instead. If the sensor 
followed a creature, there is a 10 percent chance that 
an additional flower will grow after 1d6 + 1 days at the 
sensor’s location at the end of each minute of the spell’s 
duration.
"
Doubloon Diver’s Goggles,"Wondrous item, uncommon
These leather and shell-covered goggles have peculiarly 
narrow lenses. While wearing the goggles, you have 
darkvision out to a range of 120 feet while underwater. 
In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
and Intelligence (Investigation) checks you make that 
rely on sight while underwater.
"
Dragon Horn Pauldron,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This single pauldron is made from the horn of a fallen

to instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving 
throw.
"
Dragon Turtle Barding,"Armor (any heavy barding), very rare
This heavy armor is made using salvaged pieces of a 
dragon turtle’s shell and can fit on a variety of common 
mounts. Once worn, the armor expands over the 
course of 1 hour to cover the creature with a defensive 
shell and enhance its natural abilities, granting it the 
following benefits:

 The creature gains a swimming speed equal to its 
walking or flying speed, whichever is higher.
"
Dragonband,"Wondrous item, rare
This metal bracelet hangs loosely from a wrist or ankle 
and is made from either brass, bronze, copper, gold, or 
silver wire. The clasp is cast in the shape of a metallic 
dragon’s head matching the metal used in the rest of the 
band.
While wearing the band, you can use an action to 
speak its command word and cause it to unravel and 
shatter, destroying the bracelet. When it does, it releases 
a powerful blast of energy in a wave around you. Each 
creature within 20 feet of the band other than you must 
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. The damage type is determined by the 
type of metal used in the band, using the table below.
Metal

The pegasus riders of Orostead were renowned for their 
prowess over the land and sky, so the neighboring merrow 
thought they were safe to plunder the city’s rich harbors.
When the winged horses plunged through the waves and 
into the harbor’s depths, the merrow realized just how 
wrong they were.
"
Dragonbreath Ammunition,"Weapon (arrow or bolt), rare
This metallic ammunition flies effortlessly on its own 
when fired. When you take the Attack action and 
make a ranged weapon attack, you can instead fire 
this ammunition at a point you can see within range. 
The arrow or bolt explodes when it reaches the point, 
destroying the ammunition and creating either a cone 
or 5-foot-wide line of dragon’s breath in the direction 
it was fired. The created effect depends on the metal it 
was cast from. Each creature in that area must make a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 damage of the 
associated type on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one. Use the table below to determine 
the effect’s area of effect and damage type:

"
Dramus’s Dancing Shoes,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)
These comfortable, wine-dark slippers give confidence 
in your dancing abilities. Even if you aren’t attuned to 
the shoes, you have advantage on ability checks made 
to dance while wearing them. If you are attuned to the 
shoes while wearing them, you can cause musical notes 
to play from them whenever you take a step, as if they 
were instruments, allowing you to use your feet as a 
spellcasting focus for your bard spells. Ability checks 
made to dance in this way are made separately from 
ones made to play music. 
"
Dream Saber,"Weapon (scimitar), rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon, and any creature it hits takes 
an extra 1d4 psychic damage. When the damage you 
deal with this weapon would reduce a creature to 0 
hit points, you can choose to magically cause it to fall 
asleep, instead of dealing the damage. The sleeping 
creature is unconscious for 10 minutes or until it takes 
damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it 
awake. When you cause a creature to fall asleep in this 
way, you can also force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, you immediately learn 
its surface thoughts and can decide what dreams it has 
while asleep. Once a creature falls asleep in this way, it 
is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
"
Dress of Defense,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This dress has several decorative armor plates adorning 
it, but is otherwise made of layers of lush and sheer 
fabric. While wearing this dress, you gain a +1 bonus 
to AC if you are wearing no armor. You can use a shield 
and still gain this benefit. As a bonus action, you can 
speak the dress’ command word to cause its armored 
plates to emit a protective magical force, causing the 
bonus to increase to +3 for 1 minute. Once this property 
of the dress has been used, it can’t be used again until 
the next dawn.
"
Dress of Many Pockets,"Wondrous item, common
This dress has six pockets that can be magically shown 
or hidden. While wearing the dress, you can use a bonus 
action to cause any number of its pockets to appear or 
vanish from it. The pockets can be located anywhere 
on the dress, and needn’t be in the same place each 
time they appear. Each pocket is large enough for a 
small parcel, measuring no more than 4 inches in any 
"
Drowner’s Pearl,"Wondrous item, common
This magic, sickly pearl contains a fragment of life 
absorbed from a body that sank to the bottom of the sea. 
While holding this pearl in your mouth, you can survive 
for 1 additional minute before you suffocate when you 
run out of breath or begin to choke underwater. Once 
this property has been used, the pearl turns to dust and 
is destroyed.
"
Dune Cowl,"Wondrous item, rare
This tough leather hat and cowl help protect you against 
the extreme heat and sun of the desert. While wearing 
the cowl, you can withstand temperatures as hot as 
200 degrees Fahrenheit, and if you have the Sunlight 
Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by the trait while 
wearing the hat.
In addition, while wearing the hat, you can use an 
action to speak its command word and throw it on 
the ground within 10 feet of you. The hat becomes a 
giant scorpion under your control and acts on its own 
initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the 
command word again, you return the hat to its normal 
form in a space formerly occupied by the scorpion.
On your turn, you can mentally command the scorpion 
if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren’t incapacitated. 
You decide what action the scorpion takes and where it 
moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general 
command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a 
location.
The hat remains in scorpion form for up to 8 hours. 
If the scorpion is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and 
reverts to its hat form. Once this property of the hat 
has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have 
passed.
"
Dusk Cleaver,"Weapon (handaxe), rare
This dark iron axe head is shaped like a crescent moon. 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon.
You can use an action to swing the axe at an area 
of magical darkness within 5 feet of you, making an 
attack roll against the darkness (AC 10). If the magical 
darkness was created by a spell, add the spell’s level to 
its AC. If you’re inside the area of magical darkness, you 
ignore the disadvantage normally imposed on this attack 
roll as a result of not being able to see. On a hit, the 
darkness is dispelled. If the darkness fills a space that’s 
larger than 60 feet on a side, the darkness in a 60-foot 
cube originating from you is dispelled instead. Once this 
property has been used, it can’t be used again until the 
next dusk.
Clink, clonk, clink,
A man is in the drink.

But why’s he there?

Clink, clonk, clink,
No one stops to blink.
For when the earl

You simply must make more.
"
Dusk Dagger,"Weapon (dagger), rarity varies
This delicately curved dagger is ornamented with 
several crescent moon designs. When you hit a creature 
who is completely in dim light or darkness with this

(uncommon), 1d8 (rare), or 1d12 (very rare) psychic 
damage.
"
Dwarven Boozehound’s Backpack,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This large, silver tank is nearly 3 feet tall and produces 
its own magical ale. It has several knobs alongside it 
and a tapered hose attached to the bottom. The tank 
holds 8 gallons of ale and completely refills daily at 
dawn. When you attune to the tank for the first time, 
it immediately fills with the magical ale. The tank is 
supported with several leather straps, allowing it to be 
easily carried. Regardless of how much ale is inside the 
tank, it always weighs 10 pounds.
You can dispense the magical ale as you would a 
normal keg, with the exception that this alcohol affects 
a creature twice as much as normal due to its magical 
nature. Alternatively, you can spend 10 minutes focusing 
on the tank and adjusting its various knobs to produce 
up to 4 special elixirs, expending 1 gallon of ale for each 
elixir you make. If you are a dwarf or are proficient with 
brewer’s supplies, you can produce this elixir over the 
course of 1 minute instead. Each elixir contains one 
ounce of concentrated liquid. A creature can drink the 
elixir using an action, granting it advantage on saving 
throws against poison and resistance to poison damage 
for 8 hours. If the creature is a dwarf, it gains 10 
temporary hit points instead. If an elixir isn’t consumed 
before the next dawn, it becomes a nonmagical, albeit 
strongly alcoholic, beverage.
While carrying the tank, you can use an action to 
point its hose at a target you can see within 30 feet of 
you, provided you have a free hand. When you do, the 
tank expels 1 gallon of the ale in a powerful blast at the 
target. If the target is an object that isn’t being worn 
or carried and weighs no more than 300 pounds, it is 
either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from 
you. If the target is a creature, make a ranged spell 
attack against it, using an attack bonus of +7. On a hit, 
the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, is pushed 
5 feet away from you, and must succeed on a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start 
of your next turn.
"
Ear Cuff of the Climber,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This brass ear cuff hangs off the side of your ear and 
dangles several polished spheres of jet from fine chains. 
While wearing the cuff, whenever you make an ability 
check to climb, you can treat a d20 roll of 7 or lower as 
an 8.
"
Eclipse Spear,"Weapon (spear), uncommon (requires attunement)
When in moonlight, this magic spear casts bright light in 
a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. 
This spear pierces through darkness to find its marks, 
allowing the attacks you make with it against targets 
obscured by magical darkness to be made without the 
disadvantage normally imposed by magical darkness. 
Attacks made with this weapon deal either piercing or 
slashing damage (your choice).
In addition, while holding the spear, you can use a 
bonus action to cast the 
branding smite
 spell from it. 
Once cast in this way, this property can’t be used again 
until the next dusk.
"
Egg of Primal Water,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This glass egg is filled with 1 ounce of enchanted 
water from the Elemental Plane of Water. You can use 
an action to throw the egg at a point that you can see 
within 30 feet of you. The egg shatters at the point 
and creates a special pool of water up to 40 feet in 
diameter centered on the point. The surface of the pool 
is an entrance to a demiplane that’s 20 feet deep and 
is always filled with water from the Elemental Plane. 
The water is potable and can be carried from the pool, 
but otherwise does not spill forth from it regardless of 
its placement. The pool remains for 24 hours, at which 
point anything left in the water is shunted out.
"
Ehagan’s Moving Ladder,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This small, square platform is 2 feet across, weighs 4 
pounds, and can hold up to 400 pounds. While standing 
on the platform, you can use a bonus action to speak its 
command word to cause it to move up to 30 feet up or 
down, or half that much if it’s carrying more than 200 
pounds. The platform can hover up to 60 feet in the 
air in this way, and can’t be moved horizontally except 
by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface 
within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it 
to move as if you were climbing.
When the platform’s property has been used for a total 
of 10 minutes, its magic ceases to function until the next 
dawn. When its magic ends in this way, the platform 
floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.
"
Elder Sequoia Scale Mail,"Armor (scale mail), rare (requires attunement by a druid)
This hardy, natural mail is made with leather and 
protected with the large outer shell of an elder sequoia 
seed cone. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing 
this armor. In addition, while wearing this armor, you 
can use your Wild Shape to transform into a mighty 
evergreen tree. The tree is 5 feet across at its base and 
can be up to 40 feet tall. Its branches extend up to 10 
feet away from its trunk and must be at least 5 feet 
above its base.
The tree has hit points equal to 5 times your druid 
level, AC 20, and vulnerability to fire damage. While 
you’re a tree, you magically retain your normal senses 
and gain tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet, but your 
speed becomes 0, and you can only use your actions to 
shuffle your limbs (as if by a breeze or rustling creature), 
revert to your normal form, or use your Wild Shape 
again.
"
Eldritch Bident,"Weapon (trident), rare (requires attunement)
This two-pronged weapon has a sickly connection to 
another plane of existence. While holding the bident, 
you can use an action to release 2 simultaneous beams 
of eldritch force from it, with each beam originating 
from one of the weapon’s prongs. Make a ranged spell 
attack for each beam, using a spell attack bonus of +7, 
against either one or two targets that you can see within 
60 feet of you. On a hit, a target takes 1d8 force damage.
If you’re a warlock, you are proficient with this 
weapon while you’re attuned to it and gain the following 
benefits:
 
y
 When you make an attack with the bident’s eldritch 
beams, you can choose to use your warlock spell 
attack bonus instead of the weapon’s normal one.
 
y
 When you hit a target with one of the eldritch 
beams, you add your Charisma modifier to the 
damage dealt by each beam, which deal 1d12 force 
damage instead of 1d8.
 
y
 When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with 
one of the eldritch beams against a creature, that 
creature must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving 
throw or be shunted to another plane of existence 
occupied by eldritch horrors. While there, the target 
is incapacitated. At the start of your next turn, the 
creature takes 2d12 psychic damage and reappears 
in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied 
space if that space is occupied.
Additionally, if you’re a warlock, you can use an 
action to cast the 
plane shift
 spell from the bident 
while holding it to transport yourself only to the plane 
of existence and location of your warlock patron. 
You remain there for up to 24 hours or until you use 
an action to return to your previous location on your 
original plane of existence. Once this property of the 
bident has been used, it can’t be used again for one year.
"
Enzymatic Gastrostaff,"Staff, very rare (requires attunement)
This staff was found in the regurgitated remains of a 
mighty tarrasque’s meal and is covered in a strange, 
magical mucus. You have resistance to acid damage 
while you hold this staff. The staff can be used as a 
magic quarterstaff and deals an extra 1d4 acid damage 
to any target it hits.
In addition, you can use an action to touch a 
Medium or smaller willing creature with the staff to 
cast the 
enlarge/reduce
 spell from it without requiring 
concentration, targeting the creature with the spell’s 
Enlarge option. While a creature is enlarged in this way, 
it deals double damage to objects and structures and 
gains 1d6 + 4 temporary hit points at the start of each 
of its turns, in addition to the spell’s normal effects. The 
effect ends early if the enlarged creature falls to 0 hit 
points. When the effect ends, the creature gains 1 level 
of exhaustion. Once this property of the staff has been 
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Eternal Slayer,"Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)
This fiery blade was fashioned from the remains of a 
cursed iron golem and burns with a relentless thirst for 
vengeance. While holding this sword, flames billow forth 
and lick up the edge the blade, casting bright light in a 
20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. 
While you’re in combat, the light’s range is doubled.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. When you make an attack with 
this sword, the toothed chain stretching along its lower 
edge begins to whir and spin, spewing flame and ripping 
apart any target it hits. Any target hit by this sword takes 
an extra 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 slashing damage. If 
the target is an aberration or fiend, this extra damage 
is doubled. This fire damage ignores resistance and 
immunity. A wooden creature, object, or structure hit 
by this weapon takes the maximum amount of damage 
from the attack.
"
Everglacier Prosthesis,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a creature 
missing a hand, arm, or leg)
When found, this item appears to be a roughly hewn 
length of ice with runes etched into its side. To attune to 
this item, you must attach it to the end of your missing 
arm or leg, at which point the ice magically attaches 
to you and forms an icy copy of the appendage it’s 
replacing. The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your 
body and can’t be removed against your will as long as 
you’re attuned to it.
While the prosthetic is attached, you have resistance 
to cold damage, and your unarmed strikes with the limb 
deal cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage.
In addition, the prosthesis has 6 icy spikes protruding 
from its surface. You can use an action while the 
prosthetic is attached to launch up to 3 of the spikes 
at one or more targets within 30 feet of you. Make a 
ranged spell attack for each spike, using an attack bonus 
of +7. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 cold damage. 1d4 + 
2 launched spikes regrow daily at dawn.
"
Evoker’s Exchange,"Wondrous item, uncommon
While wearing this amulet, you can choose to convert 
the damage from one form of raw energy to another. 
You can use this amulet as a spellcasting focus when 
you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals only fire 
or lightning damage and doesn’t require concentration. 
When you do, you can choose to have the spell deal 
lightning damage if it originally dealt fire, or fire damage 
if it originally dealt lightning.
If a spell that deals fire damage would normally ignite 
flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried, it 
does not if it’s converted to lightning damage in this way. 
However, a spell that deals lightning damage does ignite 
such objects if it’s converted to deal fire damage instead.
"
Eyedrops of Clarity,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This eyedropper is stoppered with a cork at the opening 
of its spherical top, which is designed in the likeness of 
an eye. When found, the eyedropper contains 1d4 + 2 
doses of magical solution. When uncorked, the solution 
inside begins to drip from the eyedropper. A creature 
can use its action to uncork and apply 1 dose of the 
eyedrops to itself or another willing creature that it can 
see within reach, stoppering the eyedropper again once 
finished. A blinded creature that has eyes and receives 
a dose of the eyedrops ceases to be blinded. In addition, 
that creature gains darkvision out to a range of 30 feet 
and has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
that rely on sight for 1 hour. If the creature already 
has darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet for the 
duration.
"
Eyes of the Beheld,"Wondrous item, uncommon
These button-sized metal trinkets typically come in sets 
of two and resemble the fearsome visage of a one-eyed 
monster. As an action, you can place one firmly on a 
solid surface—such as a wall, table, or boot—where it 
remains until destroyed. While you’re within 5 feet of 
one, you can use a bonus action to speak the command 
word to cause its eye to open. The opening is about the 
size of a keyhole, and by peering through it, you can 
open and see through another eye’s opening of your 
choice. You choose which eye to look through the first 
time you peer into the hole and can change it again 
using a bonus action.
The eyes you can choose to see through in this way 
must be a part of the set, be placed on a solid surface, 
and be on the same plane of existence as the one you’re 
looking through. You can only see through one eye at a 
time, which operates both ways, and nothing can pass 
through the hole. If another eye attempts to look through 
one you’re already using, the connection between the 
first two ends and is replaced by the new one. An eye 
closes when it’s no longer being looked through.
Each eye has AC 10 and 5 hit points. If it drops to 
0 hit points, the eye is destroyed. If a target or area 
is immune to divination magic or can’t be perceived 
through scrying sensors, it doesn’t appear through 
the hole. If you find another eye of the beheld, you can 
connect it to an existing set by holding it against another 
eye from the set for 1 minute.
"
Faeflame Torch,"Wondrous item, rare
This magic torch was harvested from a tree in the Safire 
Wood, one of the most beautiful and deadly fey forests. 
While holding the torch, you can use a bonus action 
to speak its first command word, causing eerie blue 
flames to appear above the head of the torch. The flames 
shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for 
an additional 20 feet. The flames are not extinguished 
when immersed in water and last until you use a bonus 
action to speak the command word again or until you 
stow the torch.
You can use an action while holding the lit torch to 
speak its second or third command word. Speaking the 
second command word causes any illusion within the 
torch’s bright light to be outlined in blue, green, or violet 
(your choice) for 1 minute. The torch can’t be used this 
way again until the next dawn.
Speaking the third command word causes the flame 
to fly from the torch and erupt at a point you can see 
within 60 feet of you, creating an explosion of blue 
flames and duplicating the effect of the 
faerie fire
 spell 
(save DC 15, no concentration required) in a 20-foot-
radius sphere centered on that point. A creature also 
takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. You can choose to end the 
effect early as a bonus action. When the effect ends, the 
flame reappears above the torch. The torch can’t be used 
this way again until the next dawn.
"
Failed Purity Spear,"Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement)
The grayed unicorn horn that rests at the top of this 
sickly spear is fractured and slowly leaks a silver, 
corrupting fluid. A 
failed purity spear
 is the rare version 
of a 
purity spear [1]
, a legendary weapon, that was made 
by a creature other than an elder fey. Its magic is a sad 
reminder that while unicorns are paragons of good, even 
their magic can become toxic when mistreated.
Corruption.
 This magic spear has 10 charges and 
regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. You 
can expend 1 charge when you hit a creature with the 
spear to cause it to inject the target with its corrupting 
fluid. When you do, the target must succeed on a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or gain 1 point of corruption, 
which last for 1 minute. A creature takes 1d4 poison 
damage at the start of each of its turns for each point 
of corruption it has, up to a maximum of 3d4 poison 
damage. This poison damage ignores resistance and 
immunity. A creature with at least 1 point of corruption 
can make another DC 15 Constitution saving throw at 
the end of each of its turns. On a success, it removes 1 
point of corruption. A creature is poisoned while it has 3 
or more points of corruption.
If you expend the spear’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 
1, the tip of the spear shatters, and the spear becomes a 
nonmagical quarterstaff.
Charge.
 If you move at least 20 feet straight toward 
a target and then hit it with the spear on the same turn, 
the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage.
Curse.
 This spear is cursed, and becoming attuned 
to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain 
cursed, you are unwilling to part with the spear, keeping 
it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage 
on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless 
no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. 
While you’re cursed, you have disadvantage on any 
saving throw against poison. However, while you are 
poisoned, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage 
rolls made with this magic weapon.
"
Fell-Rider Chariot,"Wondrous item, legendary
This Large, dark iron chariot weighs 300 pounds and 
can fit up to four Medium or smaller creatures. While 
you’re in the chariot, you have resistance to fire damage. 
Two sets of floating, flaming reins appear when you 
stand in the chariot, which are harmless to you. As an 
action, you can crack the reins downward to summon 
two armored nightmares that are hitched to the front 
of the chariot. The nightmares have a +1 bonus to AC 
and exist until they drop to 0 hit points. You can use 
an action to dismiss them, which works only if you are 
standing on the chariot. The nightmares are friendly 
to you, fight only to protect themselves, and can’t be 
unhitched from the chariot. The nightmares’ hitches 
prevent them from being ridden.
The nightmares regain all lost hit points when they 
are dismissed for 24 hours. When a nightmare drops to 
0 hit points, it can’t be summoned again until 1d4 + 1 
days have passed. If the second nightmare drops to 0 hit 
points while the first one can’t be summoned in this way, 
the second nightmare reappears at the same time as the 
first.
The chariot is drawn where the nightmares pull it, 
which you control by holding the reins. If you have a 
good alignment, there is a 20 percent chance each turn 
you move the chariot that the nightmares ignore your 
command and stop in their tracks. While both night-
mares are pulling the chariot, it shares their average 
movement speeds and stays upright when flying. While 
only one nightmare is pulling the chariot, the night-
mare’s speed is halved, and it has a flying speed of 0.
While both nightmares exist, you can use an action 
while holding the reins to cause the nightmares, 
the chariot, and any creatures or objects inside it to 
magically enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material 
Plane, or vice versa.
"
Felling Greataxe,"Weapon (greataxe), uncommon
This large axe has felled thousands of trees since its 
creation, giving it a ring-like pattern on its blade and 
a unique enchantment. As an action, you can speak 
the axe’s command word and swing it to cause a large, 
spectral tree to fall down in a line 60 feet long and 5 
feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 
13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 
3d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a 
success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t 
knocked prone. The spectral tree vanishes immediately 
after the effect. This property can’t be used again until 
the next dawn. In the meantime, the axe can still be 
used as a magic weapon.
In addition, you have advantage on any ability check 
you make to cut down a tree when you’re using the axe 
to chop it down.
"
Feywatch Shield,"Armor (shield), uncommon
This metal shield of elven make is a classic gift to allies 
of the fey. While holding it, you gain a +5 bonus to ability 
checks made to identify or perceive illusions and on 
saving throws against becoming charmed.
"
Feywood Ivy,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid, 
ranger, or fey creature)
This tiny seed has a glowing rune on its shell. While 
holding the seed against a weapon or similar held 
object, you can speak its first command word as 
an action to cause the seed to sprout and cover the 
object with green and purple vines. The vines form 
a comfortable grip with which to hold the object and 
also create a protective cover for it, such as a sheath or 
carrying case, that automatically stows the object while 
it isn’t being held, unless you decide for it not to. You can 
use an action to speak the first command word again to 
cause the vines to retreat from the object and return to 
the seed.
While an object is covered by the vines, you can’t be 
disarmed of that object unless you are incapacitated. In 
addition, the object can be used as a spellcasting focus 
for you.
While the vine-covered object is on your person, 
you can use a bonus action to speak the vines’ second 
command word to cause them to lash out at a Medium 
or smaller target that you can see within 5 feet of you. 
The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving 
throw or be grappled for 1 minute. While grappled, the 
target is restrained and can use an action on each of its 
turns to make a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity check (its 
choice), freeing itself and ending the effect on a success. 
The effect ends early and frees the target if you move 
more than 5 feet away from it. Once this property has 
been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Fists of the Guiding Star,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a 
monk)
Stars and celestial bodies glimmer through these hand 
wrappings. While wearing these wraps over your hands, 
you can use a bonus action to spend 1 ki point to cause 
small motes of starlight to guide a creature you can see 
within 30 feet of you, giving it advantage on the next 
attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn. If 
that creature’s next attack hits, the attack deals extra 
radiant damage equal to your Martial Arts die + your 
Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).
In addition, you can use an action to cast the 
light
 
cantrip while wearing these wraps.
"
Flamebreather Staff,"Weapon (quarterstaff), uncommon (requires attunement)
This red, hollow quarterstaff releases a plume of 
fire when spun. When you hit with an attack using 
this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d4 fire 
damage.
In addition, while holding the quarterstaff, you can 
speak its command word as an action to cause it to 
release a gout of flame from its end, duplicating the 
effect of the 
burning hands
 spell (save DC 13). This 
property of the quarterstaff can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
"
Flood Pauldron,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This jewel-encrusted pauldron has the distinct 
appearance of a large conch shell. While wearing this 
pauldron, you can breathe underwater, and you have a 
swimming speed of 30 feet.
While worn, the pauldron releases a thin veil of 
illusory water, creating a small, watery cape behind 
you. While wearing it, you can use an action to speak 
its command word to cause the water to become real. 
When you do, the water pours from the shell in a 
flooding torrent that extends from you to form a 10-foot-
radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of water that moves with 
you and remains centered on the ground beneath you. 
The cylinder lasts as long as you concentrate (as if 
concentrating on a spell), up to 10 minutes. However, 
if you move in such a way that causes you to leave the 
cylinder, such as by swimming upward and climbing out 
of it, the effect ends.
Any creature other than you in the cylinder when it 
appears must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On 
a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage 
and is pushed away from you to the nearest unoccupied 
space outside of the cylinder. On a successful save, a 
creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.
Once this property of the pauldron has been used, it 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Focus Breaker,"Weapon (maul), rare (requires attunement)
Forged during the Upheaval, these brutish weapons 
were given to members of the guard to quell any arcanist 
uprising. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature 
concentrating on a spell with this weapon, runes start 
to glow on the weapon’s head, and that creature makes 
the resulting Constitution saving throw to maintain its 
concentration with disadvantage.
As an action, you can speak the weapon’s command 
word and hold it aloft, causing the metal book adorning 
the head of the maul to wildly turn its pages and shatter. 
When it does, any spell or magical effect within 60 feet 
of you is dispelled, as if affected by the 
dispel magic
 
spell (5th-level version). A spell or magical effect cast 
using a 6th-level spell slot or higher is unaffected in this 
way. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used 
again and the book disappears from the head of the 
weapon.
"
Focus Circlet,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a 
spellcaster)
While wearing this silver circlet, you gain a bonus to 
Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain 
your concentration on a spell you cast equal to the 
spell’s level, up to a maximum of +3.
"
Fool’s Lamp,"Wondrous item, very rare
This brass lamp is decorated with flowing patterns 
around a blue, glass chamber at its center. Swirling, 
magenta clouds drift within the lamp and billow eagerly 
whenever it’s held. Created as a grim sculpture by 
a spiteful djinni, this lamp offers no benefit to those 
foolish enough to encounter it.
An 
identify
 or 
legend lore
 spell correctly reveals the 
lamp to be empty, as well as its true nature. However, 
"
Forecaster’s Cloak,"Wondrous item, common
This warm, fur-lined cloak creates illusory 
representations of the impending weather. While 
wearing this cloak, you can use an action to open it and 
speak its command word to create a harmless, sensory 
effect within the cloak that represents what the weather 
will be at your location for the next 8 hours. This effect 
persists for 1 minute or until you close the cloak.
"
Forgekeeper’s Spark,"Wondrous item, uncommon
A lingering fragment of a fire spirit remains attached 
to this piece of coal, keeping it covered in harmless 
blue embers that are pleasantly warm to the touch. 
When surrounded by fire, the coal burns with a magical 
blue flame and the spirit within it emerges. The spirit 
remains until the fire goes out or is doused, at which 
point the spirit hides within its coal until immersed in 
flames once more. If removed from the fire, the spirit 
moves with the burning coal and remains for up to 1 
minute.
While the spirit is present, it helps tend to the fire 
it’s placed in. The spirit can maintain a fire that fills up 
to a 5-foot cube. A fire tended to by the spirit gains the 
following benefits:
 
y
 It can’t be extinguished by strong winds.
 
y
 It produces no smoke, unless you want it to.
 
y
 It burns for twice the normal duration with the 
same amount of fuel.
 
y
 Any food being cooked in the fire is kept at an ideal 
temperature.
In addition, you have advantage on any ability 
check you make that uses either cook’s utensils or 
glassblower’s, smith’s, or tinker’s tools to heat and craft 
items in the fire. If you roll a 15 or higher on the d20, 
the time it takes to use the tools in this way is halved.
Sentience.
 The 
forgekeeper’s spark
 is a sentient 
lawful neutral item with an Intelligence of 1, a Wisdom 
of 6, and a Charisma of 1. It is immune to fire damage 
and has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. 
It can’t speak or read, but understands Common and 
Ignan.
Personality.
 The 
forgekeeper’s spark
 is happiest 
in the fires of a forge, but also enjoys maintaining 
campfires. It is strict with the boundaries of its fire, 
preventing it from spreading uncontrollably, and is 
resourceful with how it manages any fuel that it’s given. 
It enjoys assisting with tasks, such as cooking and 
metalworking, and snaps and pops with excited sparks 
when given something new to heat up.
"
Forgework Dragon Shield,"Armor (shield), rare
While holding this plated brass shield, you gain a +1 
bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s 
normal bonus to AC. The shield has a metallic maw in 
the visage of a dragon forged into the face of the shield, 
and small plumes of flame occasionally leap from 
openings in the shield’s plates.
When a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with 
an attack, you can use your reaction to retaliate with 
the shield. When you do, a gout of flame erupts from the 
shield, forcing the attacker to make a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d10 fire 
damage and ignites. Until a creature takes an action to 
douse the fire, the target takes 1d10 fire damage at the 
start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the target 
takes half as much damage and doesn’t ignite. Once this 
property has been used, it can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
"
Fortune’s Flower,"Wondrous item, common
These magic flowers are said to bring good luck and 
are often given as gifts at weddings. You can use an 
action to pull off and drop one of the flower’s five petals. 
When you do, there is a 5 percent chance that the petal 
glimmers in a flash of light as a rune is burnt into it, 
recreating the effects of the 
augury
 spell. When it does, 
1d6 new 
fortune’s flowers
 grow at that petal’s location 
after 30 days if the ground is suited for growth.
The plant has no seeds and can’t be repotted for 
travel. An unpicked 
fortune’s flower
 regrows one flower 
every year. Once picked, the flower can survive up to 7 
days before it withers and dies.
"
Foxfire Charm,"Wondrous item, common
This ebony charm is decoratively shaped into a fox’s 
head and is always slightly warm to the touch. It 
measures 4 inches across and weighs 1/2 pound. If 
the charm is placed in a sufficiently hot fire, such as 
in a campfire, forge, or oven that fills up to a 10-foot 
cube, the charm begins to glow red-hot and creates a 
harmless, but comfortably warm, fire elemental in an 
unoccupied space within 5 feet of the fire. The elemental 
is in the form of a fox and can’t move farther than 
100 feet from the fire in which its charm is kept. The 
elemental’s singular goal is to supply this fire with fuel. 
If the fire begins to burn out, the elemental will search 
the surrounding area for fuel that isn’t being worn or 
carried.
The fox uses the statistics for a cat, except that it’s 
an elemental instead of a beast, is immune to fire and 
poison damage, and understands Common and Ignan 
but can’t speak. The elemental has advantage on ability 
checks to find fuel for its source fire and sheds bright 
light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 
10 feet. It can carry fuel back to the fire as normal, 
provided that it’s appropriate to the elemental’s size. If 
the elemental drops to 0 hit points, touches fire, or its 
source fire goes out, it vanishes and the charm grows 
cold and dark again until it’s placed in a new fire.
"
Freerunner’s Armor,"Armor (light), common
While wearing this armor, you feel light on your feet and 
agile. When you make a long jump onto or alongside 
a wall or similar surface that isn’t slippery for the first 
time on your turn, you can move along that wall for 
the length of the jump during the move. While on that 
surface, you can make a second jump, provided you have 
the movement to do so.
"
Frostburn Spear,"Weapon (spear), very rare (requires attunement)
This magic spear harnesses both ice and fire to 
duplicate the natural destructive force of a remorhaz. 
Immediately after you throw the spear and it hits or 
misses a target, it flies back to your hand.
While holding the spear, it becomes covered in icicles 
and sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 
for an additional 20 feet. When you hit with an attack 
using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 
cold damage. You can speak its command word as a 
bonus action to cause the ice to melt and be replaced 
with flames, causing the bonus damage to become fire 
damage instead. You can speak the command word 
again to extinguish the flames and cause the ice to 
regrow from the spear, turning the bonus damage to 
"
Furious Flail,"Weapon (flail), very rare (requires attunement by a 
barbarian)
This magic stone flail has the heavy property. If you’re 
raging while holding the flail, its volcanic nature reacts 
to your fury. When it does, the basalt handle extends, 
giving the weapon both the reach and versatile (1d10) 
properties. In addition, while you’re raging, the flail 
deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to any target it hits. You 
take 1d4 fire damage when the flail transforms in this 
way and again at the start of each of your turns if you’re 
holding the flail. The flail returns to its normal form and 
cools if you are no longer holding it at the end of your 
turn or if your rage ends.
Volcanic Fury.
 You can use an action to smash the 
flail into the ground at a point within the weapon’s 
reach. When you do, the ground erupts, spewing a 
mixture of earth and fire in a 20-foot cube centered 
on that point. Each creature other than you in that 
area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a 
failed save, a creature takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage 
and 2d12 fire damage, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. In addition, the ground in that area 
becomes difficult terrain until cleared. It takes 1 minute 
to clear an affected 5-foot-square space of the rubble by 
hand. Once this property of the flail has been used, it 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Fused Chimeric Hide,"Armor (hide), rare (requires attunement by a barbarian or 
druid)
This armor is made from the three unique hides of 
a fearsome chimera, creating an armor that’s both 
imposing and practical. You have a +1 bonus to AC while 
wearing this armor.
In addition, when you enter a rage or use your Wild 
Shape to transform into a beast, you can take on a 
special aspect, choosing one of the options below.
Aspect of the Dragon.
 Your skin hardens into plate-
like scales, granting you 20 temporary hit points and 
resistance to fire damage.
Aspect of the Goat.
 You grow a pair of ram’s horns. 
If you already have horns, this aspect causes them to 
grow larger and more powerful. When you move at least 
20 feet straight toward a target no more than one size 
larger than you and immediately make a melee weapon 
attack against it, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength 
saving throw or be knocked prone.
Aspect of the Lion.
 You grow a shimmering mane 
that wreathes your head and neck, and your teeth 
become fangs. You have advantage on melee attack roll 
against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 
feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
Each aspect lasts for 1 minute. At the end of the 
duration, you revert to your normal form or beast shape. 
Once you take on the aspect of a creature in this way, 
you can’t take on that aspect again until the next dawn.
"
Gateway Ring,"Ring, very rare
Made from tiny, moss-covered stones, this ring is 
enchanted with ancient fey magic. You can use an action 
to speak the ring’s command word, followed by the 
name or description of a precise location on any plane 
of existence, and toss it into an unoccupied space within 
10 feet of you. The ring expands into a 5-foot circular 
stone portal that’s 1 foot thick in the space where it 
lands, floating 1 foot off the ground, where it remains for 
up to 1 minute.
The portal duplicates the effect of the 
gate
 spell, 
creating another stone portal at the destination. This 
version of the spell can’t target an individual creature, 
but can be used to target a precise location on the same 
plane of existence as you.
You can end the spell and close the portal early by 
speaking the ring’s command word again as an action 
while touching it with your hand. When you do, the ring 
returns to its normal size and reappears on your hand. If 
the portal remains for the full duration, the ring returns 
to its normal size and falls to the ground on a random 
side of the portal. Once the ring has been used, it can’t 
be used again until 10 days have passed.
"
Gauntlets of Deliverance,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a 
paladin)
These silver gauntlets are inscribed with powerful sigils 
that absorb malady and infection. When you magically 
cure a creature of blindness, deafness, disease, or 
poison while wearing these gauntlets, you can choose 
to have the sigils on the gauntlets contain the condition 
instead of destroying it outright. While the gauntlets 
contain a condition in this way, you can use a bonus 
action to touch a creature and force it to make a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target 
suffers the effects of the stored condition until the end 
of your next turn, as the condition is passed from the 
gauntlets into it. Whether the creature succeeds or fails 
the saving throw, the stored condition is then lost from 
the gauntlets.
The gauntlets can only hold one condition at a time. 
Any contained condition is lost if you contain another 
one in order to make room for the new condition.
"
Gauntlets of Eldritch Ferocity,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a warlock)
These leather gloves are protected with ancient stone 
plates inscribed with indecipherable runes. When you 
hit a target with the 
eldritch blast
 spell while wearing 
these gauntlets and roll damage, you can treat any 1 on 
a damage die as a 2.
Additionally, while wearing these gauntlets, you can 
choose to create an additional beam of energy and 
make an extra attack whenever you cast 
eldritch blast
. 
When you roll a 1 or 2 on an attack roll made with this 
extra beam, you take 3d12 necrotic damage, and until 
you finish a short or long rest, your hit point maximum 
is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage 
you take. This necrotic damage ignores resistance and 
immunity, and if it reduces you to 0 hit points, you die.
"
Gelatinous Whip,"Weapon (whip), uncommon (requires attunement)
This whip was pulled from the ooze of a gelatinous 
cube. When motionless, the whip appears to be a sword 
hilt with a blob of ooze at its end. When you attack with 
this magic weapon, the ooze extends elastically to form 
the length of the whip. This whip adds 10 feet to your 
reach when you attack with it, instead of 5. Targets hit 
by this weapon are marked with an acidic residue. At the 
start of each of your turns, any marked target takes 1d4 
acid damage, and the acidic residue disappears.
While you are attuned to this weapon, its ooze is 
harmless to you.
"
Gentleman’s Saber,"Weapon (longsword or scimitar), rare (requires attunement)
This elegant blade has a gently curved handle and a 
guard in the shape of a shield. Even if you aren’t attuned 
to the sword, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage 
rolls made with this magic weapon, and if you make an 
opportunity attack with the weapon and hit, the target 
takes an extra 1d6 slashing damage from the attack.
If you’re attuned to the weapon, the weapon’s shield-
like guard changes its design to match your family 
crest. In addition, the sword has 3 charges, which you 
can use only if you’re attuned to it. When you’re hit by a 
ranged attack while holding the sword, you can use your 
reaction to expend 1 of its charges to hold the blade 
in front of you. Roll a d6. A domed, spectral barrier 
appears from the blade’s tip, granting you a bonus to AC 
against ranged attacks equal to the number rolled on 
the d6 until the start of your next turn, including against 
the triggering attack. The sword regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn.
"
Gi of Shifting Seasons,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a monk)
When found, this gi is gray with a large tree design at 
its bottom hem. When you attune to the gi, its color and 
tree design changes to resemble the current season: 
Winter (blue, leafless), Spring (green, pink blossoms), 
Summer (red, green leaves), or Autumn (Yellow, red 
leaves along the bottom hem). While the gi resembles a 
season, it gains the following respective benefits:
Winter.
 You are immune to the effects of extreme 
cold, and whenever you hit a creature with one of the 
attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, that creature’s 
speed is reduced by 5 feet (to a minimum speed of 15 
feet) until the start of your next turn.
Spring.
 When the gi changes to this season, you gain 
1d4 + 4 temporary hit points. In addition, when you use 
your Step of the Wind, your jump distance is tripled, 
instead of doubled, and you ignore the effects of difficult 
terrain until the end of your turn.
Summer.
 You are immune to the effects of extreme 
heat, and whenever you hit a target with an unarmed 
strike, the target takes an additional 2 fire damage. 
If you are outside during the day, the target takes an 
additional 3 fire damage, instead.
Autumn.
 You have advantage on Constitution saving 
throws. When you use your Patient Defense, creatures 
provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 
within 5 feet of you until the start of your next turn.
You can change the gi’s season to another one of 
your choice by spending 1 minute in silent meditation. 
Alternatively, whenever you use an action, bonus action, 
or reaction to spend 1 or more ki points, you can choose 
to shift the gi’s season by one, moving in chronological 
order. When you do, you choose whether to gain the 
season’s benefits before or after the action. For example, 
if the gi is in Autumn and you spend 1 ki point to use 
Flurry of Blows, the gi can immediately change to 
represent Winter and grant the season’s benefits to your 
Flurry of Blows.
"
Giantcraft Ambusher,"Weapon (greataxe), rare
This dark metal axe contains the brute force of a fire 
giant inside and requires a Strength of 15 or higher 
in order to wield it. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
While holding the weapon, you can speak its 
command word using a bonus action to magically 
enlarge it. When you do, the weapon grows to three 
times its normal size until the start of your next turn. 
While enlarged, this axe has the reach property and 
deals an extra 2d12 slashing damage to any target it 
hits. The axe’s weight doesn’t change. While the axe is 
enlarged, it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack 
rolls due to its larger size. Once this property of the 
axe has been used, it can’t be used again until the next 
dawn.
"
Gladius of the Everfighter,"Weapon (shortsword), legendary (requires attunement by a 
fighter)
This worn gladius has been used by numerous famed 
warriors over centuries. When swung, the sound of 
a valiant battlecry can be faintly heard. You gain a 
+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this 
magic weapon. While holding this weapon, you gain an 
additional use of your Second Wind and Action Surge 
class features, but can use Action Surge only once on a 
turn.
As an action, you can speak the weapon’s command 
word to transform it into a different simple or martial 
melee weapon of your choice. When you do, the weapon 
glimmers with a golden sheen and becomes mutable, 
allowing you to use a bonus action to mentally change 
the weapon’s form again for the duration. The weapon 
remains mutable for 1 minute or until you use a bonus 
action to end the effect early. It reverts to its normal 
form when it’s no longer mutable.
While the gladius is transformed into a weapon 
with the thrown property, it flies back to your hand 
immediately after you make a ranged attack with it.
Sentience.
 The 
gladius of the everfighter
 is a sentient 
weapon of lawful neutral alignment with an Intelligence 
of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has 
hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
The weapon communicates telepathically with its 
wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. 
It has a stern and commanding voice.
Personality.
 The 
gladius of the everfighter
 is sworn 
to do battle for eternity. It grows tired of diplomacy 
quickly and believes that disputes are best settled 
through combat, either lethal or otherwise. It only finds 
comradery with its wielder after overcoming a powerful 
adversary together. It strongly resists being parted from 
its wielder for any length of time, preferring instead to 
search out new tests of strength.
If the gladius enjoys a fight that would normally end 
in the death of the opposing creature, it can choose to 
knock the creature out instead of killing it.
The seasons change at their 
own pace: we cannot pretend 
to control nature’s course. 
We must simply take time to 
enjoy the wisdom each season 
provides.
"
Glaive of the Revenant King,"Weapon (glaive), legendary (requires attunement)
This long-lost silver glaive once belonged to an elven 
king. Its impeccable elven make lets it be swung nimbly, 
despite its size. This weapon has the finesse property. In 
addition, you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon.
Sentience.
 The glaive is a sentient weapon of chaotic 
good alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 
15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision 
out to a range of 120 feet.
The weapon communicates telepathically with its 
wielder and can speak, read, and understand Elvish and 
Sylvan.
Personality.
 The glaive is inhabited by the spirit of 
Kelren, the elven king of Imfe Mythse. His life’s mis-
sion to rid his kingdom of demons, fiends, and other 
unwelcome ilk lives on inside the weapon. He seeks 
to rebalance the flow and seasons of nature, eager to 
destroy anything that threatens to change the natural 
ecosystems of the world.
Kelren is stern, but honest. He may share stories of 
his kingdom from time to time if an anecdote serves to 
further his ambitions. A character who he deems unwor-
thy of wielding the blade, such as a weak or evil crea-
ture, may be denied the ability to attune to the weapon.
Elven Kinship.
 You are considered proficient with 
this weapon if you are an elf or half-elf. In addition, 
while attuned to this weapon, you have advantage on 
Charisma checks made to interact with fey creatures.
Energy Nullification.
 If you hit a target with this 
weapon that is either resistant or immune to cold or fire 
damage, that target loses that resistance or immunity 
until the end of your next turn.
"
Glass Carver,"Weapon (dagger), uncommon
This magic dagger’s edge is lined with a sharp, 
enchanted crystal that magically pierces through glass. 
While holding the dagger, you can use an action to cut a 
straight line up to 1 foot long into a piece of nonmagical 
glass no more than 1 inch thick. Each line emits a faint 
glow, allowing you to see any lines you’ve made. Making 
these lines requires you to focus, as if concentrating 
on a spell. Your concentration ends early if you are no 
longer holding the dagger or aren’t within reach of the 
glass. When your concentration ends, any line you made 
with the dagger magically vanishes and repairs itself.
You can connect these lines to form a cutout shape 
in the glass. As part of the action to complete this 
shape, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The 
DC for this check is equal to 8 plus half the number 
of actions it took to form the shape. On a success, you 
silently remove the cutout glass shape. On a failure, 
the cutout glass shatters. Once the shape is removed in 
this way, either in one piece or as shattered glass, your 
concentration ends without repairing the glass.
If the original glass shape is returned to the hole, you 
can spend 1 minute retracing the cuts made to the glass 
with the dagger to seamlessly repair the damage done to 
it, as if by the mending spell.
"
Gloves of Amphibios,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
These gloves come in many different colors and meld 
seamlessly into your hands when you don them. While 
wearing these gloves, climbing doesn’t cost you extra 
movement, you gain a +1 bonus to Strength (Athletics) 
checks made to grapple a creature, and any creature 
grappled by you that is not wearing armor takes 1d4 
poison damage at the end of each of your turns.
"
Gloves of Healing,"Wondrous item, rare
These silken gloves enhance the rejuvenating power of 
healers and clerics. While wearing the gloves, whenever 
you cast a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points 
to one or more creatures, you can choose one target of 
the spell to regain additional hit points equal to your 
proficiency bonus.
Alternatively, a creature can regain these additional 
hit points if you use a healer’s kit to stabilize or restore 
hit points to it. Once a creature regains extra hit points 
in this way, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or 
long rest.
"
Gloves of Mimicry,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a bard)
These brightly colored gloves extend a peculiar psychic 
magic to your hands and fingers. While wearing the 
gloves, you can use an action to cast the 
mage hand
 
spell from them. In addition, you can use an action to 
cast the 
arcane hand
 spell from the gloves (save DC 16, 
spell attack +8). Once the gloves have been used to cast 
this spell, they can’t be used to cast it again until the 
next dawn.
The gloves have 5 charges for the following 
properties. They regain 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily 
at dawn.
Applaud.
 When a creature other than you that can see 
and hear you rolls a Bardic Inspiration die, you can use 
your reaction to expend 1 of the gloves’ charges to clap 
your hands together and add your Charisma modifier to 
the total of the roll. You can choose to use this reaction 
after the creature rolls the die, but before the GM 
determines whether the roll succeeds or fails.
Barrier.
 When you’re hit by an attack, you can use 
your reaction to expend 1 of the gloves’ charges and 
hold your hands out in front of you, as if you were 
pressed against an invisible barrier. You gain a +5 bonus 
to AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to 
miss you.
Pinch.
 By holding your thumb and forefinger less 
than an inch apart, you can use an action to expend 1 of 
the gloves’ charges to visually pinch a creature within 
60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must must 
make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. The creature 
takes 3d4 psychic damage and 3d4 force damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. If the creature was concentrating on a spell, that 
creature has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes 
to maintain its concentration.
"
Gloves of the Great Badger,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This pair of fingerless gloves is decorated with badger-
like stripes and fitted with razor-sharp claws. While 
wearing the gloves, your unarmed strikes with them deal 
slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, 
instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an 
unarmed strike. In addition, you gain a burrowing speed 
of 5 feet.
While wearing the gloves, you can use a bonus action 
to invoke the might of a giant badger, granting the 
following benefits for 1 minute:
 
y
 Your burrowing speed is doubled, and you can 
burrow through nonmagical, unworked stone.
 
y
 You gain a +1 bonus to your attack and damage rolls 
whenever you make an unarmed strike with the 
gloves.
 
y
 Your unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 
19 or 20.
Once this property has been used, it can’t be used 
again until the next dawn.
"
Gnashing Key,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This curious brass key is animated by a weak 
enchantment. When placed in the keyhole of a lock, it 
magically begins to open and shut its mouth-like key 
bit, loudly destroying the inside of the lock over the 
course of 1 minute. At the end of the minute, the lock 
is destroyed and forced open. If the lock’s DC is greater 
than 15, the key has a percent chance to break before 
the end of the minute. The percent chance is equal to 5 
times the difference between the lock’s DC and 15. If the 
key breaks, the lock is instead jammed shut and the key 
is destroyed, but can still be seen protruding from the 
keyhole.
While the key is destroying a lock, the sound of 
breaking tumblers and grating metal can be heard out to 
a range of 90 feet.
"
Godsteel Warplate,"Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)
While wearing this shimmering armor, you gain a 
supernatural buffer to your vitality and resilience. 
The first time you don and attune to this armor, and 
whenever you finish a long rest while attuned to it, you 
gain 50 temporary hit points. You lose these temporary 
hit points if you remove the armor. While wearing 
this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and if you 
have temporary hit points, you also have resistance to 
nonmagical damage.
"
Godsteel Worldcarver,"Weapon (greatsword or longsword), legendary (requires 
attunement)
This hefty blade becomes miraculously nimble in hand, 
as if a portion of its weight were displaced elsewhere. If 
the weapon is a greatsword, Small creatures don’t make 
attack rolls with disadvantage using this weapon as a re-
sult of its heavy property. You gain a +2 bonus to attack 
and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which 
deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage to any target it hits.
While holding the weapon, you can use a bonus action 
to magically store it in a special extradimensional space. 
While the weapon is stored in this space, you can use a 
bonus action to magically retrieve it again, causing the 
weapon to reappear in your hand. If the sword is ever 
more than 30 feet away from you, it magically vanishes 
into the space on its own.
When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this 
weapon, you can force the target to make a DC 17 
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target 
takes an extra 3d8 radiant damage, and if the target is 
a creature, it is incapacitated and banished to a special 
demiplane until the start of your next turn, at which 
point the target reappears in the space it left or in the 
nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. On 
a successful save, the target takes half as much radiant 
damage and isn’t incapacitated or transported. If you are 
a cleric or paladin, you and each creature of your choice 
within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points 
equal to half the radiant damage dealt in this way.
"
Golem Sapper,"Wondrous item, rare
This octagonal device is roughly fist sized and weighs 
1/2 pound. As an action, you can place the device on a 
construct within your reach. When you do, the creature 
must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a 
failed save, the creature takes 2d10 necrotic damage 
and is stunned until the start of your next turn, at 
which point it can repeat the saving throw. Each time 
the creature makes this saving throw after the first, 
the DC is reduced by 2 (to a minimum DC of 10). On a 
successful save, the device falls from the creature and 
can’t be used again for 1 hour.
The device’s saving throw DC remains reduced after 
being used. The DC increases by 2 for every 24 hours it 
isn’t in use, up to a maximum DC of 18.
"
Gorget of the Holy Soldier,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a 
creature of good alignment)
This magical gorget is imbued with the divine power of 
a planetar and has been passed down through multiple 
generations, manifesting a different power for each 
wearer. While wearing the gorget, you have resistance 
to radiant damage and gain the following benefits. If you 
have a feature that allows you to ignore class, race, or 
level requirements when you use a magic item, you can 
choose to gain the benefits of one of these properties. 
You make this choice the first time you attune to the 
item.
Investiture of the Planetar.
 If you have 10 or more 
levels in the barbarian class, your Strength score 
increases by 2, to a maximum of 26, and while you’re 
raging, any creature you hit with a melee weapon attack 
takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage.
Litany of Heaven.
 If you have 10 or more levels in the 
bard class, you gain the ability to speak and understand 
all languages. In addition, whenever you give a creature 
a Bardic Inspiration die, that creature regains a number 
of hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier.
Divine Judge & Jury.
 If you have 10 or more levels in 
the cleric class, you always have the 
commune
, 
dispel 
evil and good
, and 
raise dead
 spells prepared, and 
they don’t count against the number of spells you can 
prepare each day. In addition, when you cast 
raise dead
 
using a spell slot, you can choose to cast it as an action, 
instead of its normal casting time. When you do, the 
spell requires no material components and returns the 
target to life with half its maximum hit points. Once this 
property has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 
days have passed.
"
Grasping Staff,"Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a warlock or wizard)
This grotesquely carved stone staff is miraculously light 
but deathly cold and clammy to the touch. You have 
resistance to necrotic damage while you hold this staff.
The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use 
an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one 
of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC 
and spell attack bonus: 
arcane hand
 (5 charges), 
bestow 
curse
 (3 charges), 
chill touch
 (no charges, or 1 charge to 
cast at 5th level), 
inflict wounds
 (1 charge per spell level, 
up to 5th), 
mage hand
 (no charges), or 
vampiric touch
 (3 
charges).
The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 
1, the staff turns to ash and summons 2d6 hostile tiny 
undead crawling hands within 10 feet of you.
The wizard’s hand felt unwelcome by the staff, as if 
it knew that it was being touched and didn’t like it. 
He dropped it, wiping his hands on his cloak.
He waved a steady hand over the stone staff and 
muttered an incantation. His eyes opened, suddenly 
aware of the staff’s power. He decided to make 
camp for the evening. It wasn’t ideal, but he felt 
safe knowing that he’d already dispatched the cave’s 
previous inhabitants.
He sat down again, focusing on the arcane 
connections he shared with other possessions. He 
felt the space open for another such connection, 
and carefully, slowly, allowed his magical being 
intertwine with the staff.
An hour later, drenched in a sweat from 
meditation, the wizard picked up the staff once more. 
This time, the hands adorning the staff seemed warm 
and welcoming: ushering him to join them.
"
Great Owl’s Shroud,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This draping shoulder cloak flutters softly while worn, 
even if there isn’t a breeze. The cloak has 10 charges 
and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When 
you take the Attack action while wearing this garment, 
you can replace one or more of your attacks with a 
special ranged spell attack using the cloak, expending 1 
of its charges for each attack you replace. When you do, 
you flourish the cloak and release a barrage of magical 
feathers that fly toward the target. You have a +5 bonus 
to attack rolls made with the cloak, which have a normal 
range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. On a hit, 
the target takes 2d4 + 3 force damage. After the attack, 
the feathers vanish.
In addition, you can use a reaction when you fall to 
cast the 
feather fall
 spell from the cloak, targeting only 
yourself. Once this property of the cloak has been used, 
it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Green Knight’s Vow,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
These dark green adamantine and copper bracers are 
granted to devout warriors of the Infernal Court and are 
designed to match their army’s signature tower shields. 
While wearing the bracers, you grow a sweeping pair of 
horns from your forehead if you are not a tiefling. If your 
attunement to the bracers ends, the horns crack and fall 
away after 24 hours.
The bracers have a total of 7 charges and regain all 
expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing them, 
you can expend 1 or more of their charges to use the 
following three properties:
“Brace Yourselves!”
 As a bonus action, you can 
expend 2 or more charges from the bracers to provide 
cover to a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. 
For 2 charges, you summon a large, spectral shield 
that follows the creature for the duration, providing it 
with half cover. You can summon one extra shield for 
each additional charge you expend, targeting a different 
creature with each one. The shields fade at the end of 
your next turn.
“Press the Assault!”
 When you make an opportunity 
attack, you can expend 1 or more of the bracers’ charges 
to embolden your nearby allies. For each charge you 
spend, one creature of your choice within 60 feet of you 
can use its reaction to make one weapon attack. The 
chosen creatures must be able to see or hear you.
“You Will Burn!”
 You can expend 1 or more charges 
from the bracers to cast the 
hellish rebuke
 spell (save 
DC 15) from them. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level 
version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level 
by one for each additional charge you expend. The fire 
from this spell is a haunting emerald green.
Flaw.
 The 
Green Knight’s vow
 makes its wearer 
tremendously loyal to royalty. While attuned to the 
bracers, you gain the following flaw: “I will stand by 
my sovereign leader, no matter what.” You or your GM 
determine who your leader is. In addition, if you are 
attuned to the bracers for 24 consecutive hours, your 
commitment to duty drives you to the brink of zealotry. 
You can’t attune to the 
Red Queen’s burden
 or the 
Violet 
King’s promise
. If you are already attuned to either of 
them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this 
effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet 
who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes 
your sovereign leader, regardless of who you previously 
considered it to be. You become charmed by them 
and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If 
you find the 
Red Queen’s burden
 or the 
Violet King’s 
promise
 without an owner, you are compelled to protect 
it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These 
effects can be removed with a 
greater restoration
 spell, 
but not while you are attuned to the bracers.
"
Griffon Coinpouch,"Wondrous item, common
This stylized purse is sewn and stitched in the style of 
the griffon’s saddlebag
, a classic treasure and character 
from children’s stories and legends. The purse is 6 
inches across and holds up to 1,000 coins. Coins taken 
from the purse are miraculously clean and shiny, as 
if freshly minted. The bag always weighs 1 pound, 
regardless of the number of coins within it.
At the GM’s discretion, a small slip of parchment can 
be found folded among the coins inside. The parchment 
can have anything on it, although it usually carries 
enigmatic warnings or peculiar words of guidance. 
The GM can write their own notes, or you can roll a 
d8 and consult the table below to determine what the 
parchment says:
d8
Message
1
Falling rocks play to the rhythm of catastrophe.
2
Whether or not you succeed, you can certainly 
try.
3
Draughts are meant to be drunk.
4
Strength in numbers.
5
Acid, fire, and diamonds can solve most 
problems.
6
Not all strangers are trustworthy.
7
Asking for directions is not a sign of weakness.

Keep on adventuring.
"
Griffon Component Pack,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This special component pouch is stylized in the fashion 
of the legendary 
griffon’s saddlebag
, a classic motif 
in children’s fiction. As an action, you can place an 
amount of coins equal to 5 gp plus the exact worth of 
a component you need for a spell you know in the bag 
and speak its command word, followed by the name 
of the needed component. When you do, the coins 
disappear from the bag and are replaced by the material 
component needed for the spell. Once this property of 
the bag has been used, it can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
At the GM’s discretion, the bag may consume only 
the additional 5gp and leave a note that describes 
the nearest person or place that can help you find the 
named component.
"
Griffon Key Loop,"Wondrous item, common
This leather key loop is stylized in the fashion of 
the legendary 
griffon’s saddlebag
, a classic motif in 
children’s fiction. You can attach a key to the key loop by 
holding them together for 1 minute. When you do, the 
key is shunted into an extradimensional space. You can 
use an action to speak the key loop’s command word, 
causing one or more of the attached keys to reappear 
on the loop (your choice). Speaking the command word 
again causes them to disappear once more. You can 
have up to 10 keys attached to the key loop in this way 
at a time, and can remove one by gently pulling on it for 
1 minute.
While holding the key loop, you can touch it to a lock 
whose key has been attached to the loop. When you do, 
the lock becomes unlocked or locked (your choice), as if 
you had used its key. When you shake the key loop, you 
can faintly hear the sound of its keys jingling.
Stories of the fabled saddlebag brought about 
the need to have one for themselves, some even 
taking to clever forgeries. Little did they know 
that the spark of inspiration would give life to 
some of the pouches.
"
Guardian’s Reliquary,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a 
creature missing an arm)
This ornate prosthetic arm is a reliquary set with 
glass windows, revealing the suspended skeletal hand 
and arm of a saint devoted to protecting others. The 
prosthesis attaches to your arm at the elbow or the 
shoulder, and it can’t be removed against your will as 
long as you’re attuned to it. To attune to this item, you 
must hold it against your arm for the entire attunement 
period. While attuned to the prosthesis, you can use an 
action to remove or reattach it. The prosthetic is a fully 
capable part of your body.
While the prosthesis is attached, you gain a +3 bonus 
to saving throws. As a bonus action, you can touch a 
creature to transfer this bonus to it. When you do, the 
bonus remains on that creature, instead of you, for 1 
minute, until it dies, or until you use a bonus action to 
return the bonus to yourself.
In addition, the prosthetic has 10 charges. You can 
use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast 
one of the following spells from it: 
greater restoration
 
(5 charges), 
lesser restoration
 (2 charges), 
protection 
from evil and good
 (1 charge), 
remove curse
 (3 charges), 
or 
warding bond
 (2 charges). The prosthetic regains all 
expended charges daily at dawn.
Final Sacrifice.
 As an action, you can use the 
prosthetic to cast either 
mass heal
 or 
true resurrection
. 
When you do, the prosthetic releases a massive burst 
of divine light as the bones inside it are destroyed. The 
prosthetic then loses all its properties, but it can still 
be used as a magical prosthetic that functions as a 
fully capable part of your body and no longer requires 
attunement.
"
Gusting Blowgun,"Weapon (blowgun), uncommon (requires attunement)
This magic, twisting blowgun channels the air around 
it to create powerful blasts of wind. When you hit with 
a ranged attack using this weapon, the target takes an 
extra 1d4 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a 
Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 
13 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away from 
you. Attacking at long range with this weapon doesn’t 
impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with it.
The blowgun has 3 charges and regains all expended 
charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 
of its charges to blow through the weapon to create a 
line of wind 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Any Medium 
or smaller creature in the line must succeed on a DC 13 
Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from 
you.
"
H’rethi Soul Scepter,"Rod, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This golden scepter has an empty basin at its end that’s 
always hot to the touch, as if it had been left out in the 
sun. While attuned to the rod, you can walk normally 
on difficult terrain caused by sand and can tolerate 
temperatures as hot as 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
The rod has 20 charges for the following properties. It 
regains 2d6 + 8 expended charges daily at dawn. If the 
rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod 
disappears in a burst of sand.
Sandblast.
 While holding the rod, you can use an 
action to expend 1 charge and send out a cascade of 
pressurized sand at a target you can see within 60 feet 
of you. Make a ranged attack roll using the scepter with 
an attack bonus of +10. On a hit, the sand deals 4d6 
bludgeoning damage and disappears after the attack.
Sandstorm.
 While holding the rod, you can use an 
action to expend 5 charges to cause a flurry of sand 
to whip up and swirl around you. The sand creates 
a blistering maelstrom that follows you in a 15-foot 
radius, 30-foot-high cylinder and makes the area heavily 
obscured for creatures other than you. It remains as 
long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), 
to a maximum of 1 hour. Arrows, bolts, and other 
ordinary projectiles fly upward and automatically miss 
when they enter the area. Any creature that moves into 
the sandstorm for the first time on its turn or starts 
its turn there must make a DC 17 Constitution saving 
throw. A creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
You are immune to this bludgeoning damage. The sand 
disappears once the storm subsides.
If you are standing on sandy ground while 
concentrating on a sandstorm, you can use a bonus 
action to teleport to another unoccupied space you can 
see within 60 feet of you that is also on sandy ground.
Sand Summon.
 While holding the rod, you can use 
an action to expend 3 charges to cause the ground in a 
30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within 60 
feet of you to turn to shifting sands for up to 1 minute. 
You can end the effect early as a bonus action. For the 
duration, a creature must spend 3 feet of movement for 
every 1 foot it moves through the area.
Soul of the H’rethi.
 While holding the rod, you can 
use an action to expend 3 charges to summon a sand 
elemental in an unoccupied space on the ground that 
you can see within 30 feet of you that’s covered in 
sand. Use the statistics for an earth elemental for this 
elemental, with the following changes:
 
y
 The sand elemental can only move through areas of 
sandy terrain.
 
y
 The sand elemental has advantage on any ability 
check it makes to grapple a creature.
The elemental remains as long as you concentrate 
(as if concentrating on a spell), up to a maximum of 1 
"
Hadiya’s Handy Quill,"Weapon (dart), uncommon (requires attunement)
This dart doubles as a magical quill and is fletched with 
three iridescent crow feathers. Immediately after you 
make a ranged attack with this magic weapon, it flies 
back to your hand. When you make a ranged attack with 
the dart, you can speak its first command word as part 
of the attack to cause the dart to release a splatter of 
ink. If the attack hits, the target is blind until the end of 
its next turn. A creature can use its action to clear away 
the ink on itself or another creature within its reach, 
allowing it to see again. This property can’t be used 
again until the next dawn.
When used as a quill, the dart produces its own 
ink unless you provide it with a different one. You can 
choose what color ink the quill produces by speaking its 
second command word as a bonus action.
In addition, you can use a bonus action to speak the 
quill’s third command word to cause it to vanish and 
reappear as a feather-like tattoo on your body. You 
choose the design and placement of the tattoo each 
time. You can use a bonus action to speak the command 
word again while you have the tattoo to cause it to 
vanish and reappear as a dart in a free hand or at your 
feet (your choice).

4 expended charges daily at midday. While wearing the 
armor, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its

your spell save DC, spellcasting ability modifier, and 
spell attack bonus:
 
y

inflict wounds
 
y
 2 charges: 
blindness/deafness

 4 charges: 
banishment
, 
death ward
 
y
 5 charges: 
contagion

 6 charges: 
harm
, 
heal
Curse.
 This armor is cursed, and attuning to it 
extends that curse to you. This curse can only be 
removed by a 
wish
 spell or similar magic, removing the 
armor fails to end the curse. While you’re cursed, you 
are blind, but have blindsight out to a range of 60 feet 
while wearing this armor. In addition, whenever you hit 
a creature with an attack or cast a spell that affects a 
creature other than yourself, you take 3 psychic damage. 
This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
"
Harbinger’s Flail,"Weapon (flail), rare
This whip-like chain flail’s head is a sonorous bell from 
the Temple of Twin Fates, a holy site known for its grim 
foretellings. This weapon has the reach property and 
deals an extra 1d4 thunder damage to any target it hits. 
When it hits a target, the bell releases a deep sound 
that’s audible out to 100 feet.

designs. When you hit a plant creature with an attack 
using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 
slashing damage. In addition, any nonmagical plant 
harvested with this sickle magically remains fresh for an 
extra 7 days.
"
Hat of Osnomnosis,"Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a wizard)
This colorful, frumpy hat contains the animated and 
sentient spirit of a wizard’s old pet. While unworn 
and immobile, it is indistinguishable from a normal 
hat. When the hat is worn and spoken to or otherwise 
interacted with, it springs to life and pulls its seams 
apart to form a stitch-ridden mouth and toothless smile.
You can use the hat as an arcane focus for your wizard 
spells while you’re wearing it. In addition, you can feed 
one piece of paper to the hat using an action, destroying 
the paper. The hat happily accepts any paper it’s fed and 
wiggles about as the page is chewed and swallowed. 
If you’re wearing the hat, you immediately know any 
information that was contained on the piece of paper 
as if you had read it. If the paper or its contents were 
magical, it’s immediately spat back out by the hat. If 
the paper contained a spell, such as a spell scroll or 
page from another wizard’s spellbook, you also take 
1d6 psychic damage for each level of the spell that was 
transcribed on the paper when it’s spat out.
Sentience.
 The 
hat of osnomnosis
 is a sentient 
chaotic good item with an Intelligence of 4, a Wisdom 
of 8, and a Charisma of 6. It has hearing and darkvision 
out to a range of 30 feet. It can’t speak or read, but 
can communicate with you telepathically while you’re 
wearing it. When the hat communicates with you in this 
way, it can only transmit simple emotions and images. 
While you are attuned to it, the hat understands every 
language you know.
Personality.
 The hat loves nothing more than being 
worn and eating bits of paper and is easily befriended by 
creatures who pet it. The hat’s button eyes can’t move, 
but it uses its cloth folds to change its expression at will.
"
Hat of the Sanguine Coven,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a 
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)
This red hat is worn by a coven of witches known for 
their familiarity with death’s doorstep. While wearing 
this hat, you can cast the 
chill touch
 spell at will. 
Whenever you have 0 hit points while wearing this hat, 
you gain the following benefits:
 
y
  You stabilize or die after your sixth successful or 
failed death saving throw, instead of your third, but 
only succeed on the saving throw on a roll of 15 or 
higher.
 
y
  When you roll a death saving throw, you can 
immediately cause the hat to cast the 
chill touch
 
spell (+5 to hit, no action required) against a 
creature within 30 feet of you that isn’t behind total 
cover or heavily obscured. If it hits, you gain a +5 
bonus to the saving throw.
"
Headband of the Sweatless,"Wondrous item, common
These vibrant silk headbands come in a variety of 
colors and patterns. While wearing the headband, you 
magically don’t get wet when you perspire, but are still 
naturally cooled as if you had. In addition, the first 
time you make a Constitution saving throw to resist the 
effects of extreme heat, add 1d4 to the total of the roll. 
This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Headdress of the Serpent King,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This gold and emerald green headdress channels old 
and twisting serpentine magic to your bidding. If you 
take poison damage while wearing this headdress, 
that damage is reduced by an amount equal to your 
Constitution modifier.
While wearing the headdress, ordinary snakes and 
snakes with a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower are 
indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless 
you threaten or harm them. In addition, you can use an 
action to cast the 
animal messenger
 spell from it, but 
can only target snakes with it.
Curse.
 This headdress is cursed, and becoming 
attuned to it extends that curse to you until you 
are targeted by the 
remove curse
 spell. Removing 
the headdress fails to end the curse on you. While 
cursed, your speech is slightly changed: you hiss when 
pronouncing “s” sounds.
"
Headhunter’s Bullseye Lantern,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This bullseye lantern magically creates its own light, 
which is always a brilliant red. It emits bright light in 
a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. 
While holding the lantern, you can use a bonus action 
to speak its command word to release an intense 
burst of light from the lantern’s lens. Each hostile 
creature within the lantern’s bright light must succeed 
on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be marked for 
1 minute. For the duration, marked creatures shed 
dim light in a 10-foot radius. Marked creatures can’t 
benefit from being invisible, and any attack roll made 
with disadvantage against a marked creature is made 
normally instead, provided that the attacker can see it. 
You choose the direction of the light when you use this 
property, which can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Heart of Damned Intervention,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric 
or paladin)
This large infernal heart was torn from a powerful 
archdevil and is 1 foot tall and weighs 10 pounds. It still 
pulses, softly, and spews out small gouts of flame from 
an unquenchable fire within. The heart is hot to the 
touch and is wrapped by strange, writhing chains.
There is a glimmer of good in this heart that can be 
used to purify it. While attuned to the heart, you have 
resistance to fire damage, and you can cast 
hellish 
rebuke
 as a 2nd-level spell at will.
Curse.
 This heart can only be purified and destroyed 
by a powerful celestial or deity, and attuning to it 
overwhelms your heart with its evil desires. The heart 
is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. 
When you attune to the heart, the heart’s flames turn 
pitch black as it painfully sears into your body, taking the 
place of your own heart, and taints your connection to 
the gods. You take 15d6 necrotic damage, leaving chain-
shaped scars across your torso, and your alignment 
becomes evil if it wasn’t already. While cursed, you and 
other creatures within 100 feet of you are unable to 
"
Heartless Cage Pendant,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This metal ribcage pendant has 12 pairs of ribs that 
contain a single, roughly hewn ruby that rattles around 
inside. The pendant has 1d4 + 8 charges when found. 
When a charge is expended, a pair of the pendant’s ribs 
magically rust.
While wearing this pendant, you can use your 
reaction to expend 1 of the pendant’s charges when 
a hostile creature that you can see within 30 feet of 
you is reduced to 0 hit points, causing the target to 
immediately die before any magical effects or traits can 
either restore it to life or prevent it from falling to 0 hit 
points. When you do, you gain 2d6 + 25 temporary hit 
points, and that creature can’t be restored to life by any 
spell of 5th level or lower. A creature is immune to this 
effect if it has legendary actions.
When you expend the pendant’s last charge, the 
ribcage shatters and releases the ruby inside. When 
it does, the ruby crackles with necrotic energy and 
summons 12 skeletons that appear in unoccupied 
spaces that you can see within 60 feet of you. The 
summoned skeletons are friendly to you and your 
companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures 
as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any 
verbal commands that you issue to them (no action 
required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to 
them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, 
but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the 
skeletons’ statistics.
A skeleton disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or 
after 24 hours.
Once the ribcage shatters and the ruby summons the 
skeletons, the pendant and gemstone crumble into ashes 
and are destroyed.
"
Heaven’s Edge,"Weapon (dagger), legendary (requires attunement)
This ornate dagger is made of multiple pieces that 
magically hover together, but move as if they were 
solidly connected. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals 
an extra 2d4 radiant damage to any creature it hits. This 
extra damage increases to 4d4 radiant damage if the 
creature is a fiend or undead.
When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this 
weapon against a fiend, the target must make a DC 15 
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is 
"
Heaven’s Gavel,"Weapon (maul), legendary (requires attunement by a 
creature of good alignment)
This platinum weapon was a gift from a divine dragon to 
one of her loyal knights and has been passed down for 
generations. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage 
rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit an 
evil-aligned creature with the weapon, that creature 
takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage.
The maul has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 
expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a 
creature no more than one size larger than you with 
the maul, you can expend up to 3 of its charges as part 
of the attack. When you do, the target must make a DC 
17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature 
is launched 10 feet away from you for each expended 
charge, or half as far on a successful one. If the target 
hits a solid object by being launched in this way, it takes 
1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it had left to 
travel from the impact. If the solid object is a creature, 
that creature takes the same amount of bludgeoning 
damage from the impact as the target of the attack.
"
Heavenly Chalice,"Wondrous item, rare
This golden goblet is ornamented with 4 glimmering 
gems and stripes of jet and ivory. It weighs 2 pounds 
and can hold the contents of one potion. When a 
potion 
of healing
 (of any rarity) is poured into the cup, a cleric, 
paladin, or other creature with a magical connection to 
a celestial can spend 1 minute reciting a prayer over it. 
At the end of the prayer, the potion becomes sanctified 
and begins to glow with a calming blue light. When a 
potion of healing
 becomes sanctified, it creates a pool 
of hit points equal to the maximum number of potential 
regained hit points possible for that potion.
When a creature drinks from a sanctified 
potion of 
healing
, that creature can restore a number of hit points 
of its choice, up to the maximum amount remaining in 
the pool. When the pool is reduced to 0 hit points, the 
potion is gone.
A potion remains sanctified for 24 hours or until it’s 
spilled or poured into another vessel. Once this property 
of the goblet has been used, it can’t be used again for 24 
hours.
"
Heavy Golem Armor,"Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement by a Small 
humanoid)
This heavy set of plate mail is 5½ feet tall, weighs 100 
pounds, and is reconfigured from the pieces of an iron 
golem. Despite the armor’s larger size, a series of clever 
harnesses inside its chest piece comfortably support you 
inside it. While wearing this armor, your Strength score 
is 19, unless it’s already higher, and you are considered 
to be a Medium creature. Magic currents run through 
the inside of the armor and connect to you, allowing you 
to control the metal limbs as if they were your own. This 
magical connection causes you to still take any damage 
you receive while wearing the armor.
While wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action 
to speak its command word to force the armor to move 
more rapidly. When it does, you gain the effect of the 
haste
 spell (no concentration required), and the armor’s 
joints creak and groan from the increased strain. At the 
end of each of your turns while you’re under this effect, 
there is a cumulative 20 percent chance that the armor 
overheats. When it does, you take 1d10 fire damage 
from the armor, and the effect ends. Once this property 
of the armor has been used, it can’t be used again until 
the next dawn.
"
Hedgewitch’s Gardening Cane,"Staff, common
This wooden walking stick has a silver flower at either 
end. The flower is blooming on the handle, but merely 
a bud towards the bottom. While holding the cane, 
you can use an action to tap it against the ground and 
mentally command the bottom portion to magically 
transform into a broom, a hoe, a rake, a shovel, or back 
into a normal cane.
"
Hedonic Motivator,"Weapon (whip), uncommon (requires attunement)
This magic whip once belonged to an especially 
controlling succubus or incubus. The whip has 3 
charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at 
dusk. While holding the whip, you can use a bonus 
action to expend 1 of its charges to lash out with it 
against a friendly creature within 10 feet of you. That 
creature gains one of the following benefits of your 
choice:
 
y
 The creature gains 2d4 + 4 temporary hit points, 
which last for 1 minute.
 
y
 The creature can add 1d4 + 2 to one ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw it makes before the start 
of your next turn.
"
Helm of the Broken Dragon,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a non-
lawful dragonborn)
This helmet is made of harsh, angular shapes that 
come together into the shape of an aberrant dragon 
skull. Your scales twist into strange, fractal-like patterns 
tinged with otherworldly colors when you attune to this 
item. While wearing the helmet, you have resistance 
to psychic damage, and creatures have disadvantage 
on Wisdom (Insight) checks against you. In addition, 
your breath weapon changes to be a plume of unearthly 
psionic energy, dealing psychic damage instead of its 
normal damage type. A creature in the area must make 
a Wisdom saving throw, instead of your breath weapon’s 
normal save. On a failed save, a creature is also 
affected as by the 
bane
 spell for 1 minute as maddening 
whispers fill its mind. The creature can make a Wisdom 
saving throw against your breath weapon DC at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a 
success.
Curse.
 This helmet is cursed with gnawing insecurity 
and self-doubt. Attuning to the helmet curses you until 
you are targeted by the 
remove curse
 spell or similar 
magic. While cursed, you are unwilling to remove the 
helm, and you gain the following flaw: “Whatever course 
of action I take, there is a voice in my head that screams 
at me to do the opposite. The voice is never silent.”

Helm of the Chromatic Dragon,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a 
dragonborn of evil alignment )
This iridescent helmet has been blessed by a powerful, 
evil dragon. While wearing this helmet, your breath 
weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of its type, and you 
can choose whether it deals acid, cold, fire, lightning 
or poison damage. You can also choose if your breath 
weapon affects a 15-foot cone or 5-by-30-foot line, and 
if creatures affected by it must make a Dexterity or 
Constitution saving throw.
In addition, when you use your breath weapon, roll 
a d6. On a 5 or 6, you gain an additional use of your 
breath weapon before you need to finish a short or long 
rest.
"
Helm of the Justicars,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This helm once belonged to Grand Mage-Arbiter Elodie 
Scolian, the preeminent leader of the surviving Justicar 
order. Designed to eliminate the threat that all mages 
pose to the nonmagical populace, the wearer of this 
helmet has an uncanny resilience against spells of all 
kinds. While wearing this helmet, you gain a +1 bonus 
to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against 
spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have 
disadvantage against you.
In addition, the helm has 12 charges and regains 
2d6 expended charges daily at dawn. Whenever you’re 
affected by a spell while wearing this helmet, you can 
use your reaction to learn the level of the spell and 
expend any number of charges from the helm (minimum 
1 charge). If the number of charges is equal to or greater 
than the level of the triggering spell, you are unaffected 
by it. A cantrip is considered to be a 1st-level spell for 
the purposes of this property.
T HE JU S T IC A R S
The Justicars were a group of radicalized mage-hunt-
ers that led the Upheaval, a hundred-year war that 
demonized those who practiced magic. You can read 
more about this war and learn how to include its last-
ing effects in your game in Part III on page 328.
"
Helm of the Platinum Dragon,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a 
dragonborn of good alignment)
This magical platinum helmet has been blessed by a 
powerful, holy dragon. While wearing this helmet, you 
gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and when you 
use your breath weapon, you can choose to exhale a 
holy blue plume of healing energy instead. When you do, 
this breath weapon deals radiant damage, evil-aligned 
hostile creatures within the area have disadvantage 
on the saving throw, and any friendly creatures in the 
area regain a number of hit points equal to your breath 
weapon’s damage dice instead. This property of the 
helm can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Helm of the Ruby Dragon,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a 
dragonborn of neutral alignment)
This magic gold and ruby helm has been blessed by a 
powerful, psychic dragon. While wearing this helmet, 
you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) 
checks, as well as Intelligence checks made to glean 
information from an observation or bit of lore. In 
addition, you can speak telepathically to any creature 
within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you 
only if the two of you share a language. You can speak 
telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.
When you use your breath weapon while wearing 
this helmet, you can choose to exhale a blast of pure, 
concussive force. When you do, your breath weapon 
deals force damage, instead of its normal damage type, 
and any creature that fails the saving throw takes an 
extra 2d6 psychic damage and is stunned until the end 
of your next turn. This property of the helm can’t be 
used again until the next dawn.
There is no joy to the life of a Justicar. For as much 
as we fight, what we fight creeps back to fill in the 
voids we cannot suppress. For what we can suppress, 
what we suppress simply hides in the cracks we can-
not see. For all we see, what we can see will convince 
itself our eyes are blind.
We tried to convince them that magic was weak, 
was heretical, was wrong. But they lived by the 
evidence of their faulted eyes, seeing only what 
they wished to of their profane ability. And in this, 
they could find their misplaced conviction, find the 
resilience to blind themselves to the truth.
That way was wrong. We could never convince 
them of their own fall.
Instead, we must convince them of this: moral or 
amoral, their magic is nothing before us.

"
Hideaway Vase,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This durable, ceramic vase is 3 feet tall and weighs 15 
pounds. You can use an action to remove the vase’s lid. 
When you do, you must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma 
saving throw or be shunted onto a harmless demiplane 
inside the vase. A Large or larger creature automatically 
succeeds on the saving throw, but a willing Medium or 
smaller creature can choose to fail it. If a creature is 
already on the demiplane when you remove the lid, that 
creature reappears in the nearest unoccupied space, 
and you automatically succeed on the saving throw. 
Immediately after opening the vase in this way, the lid 
flies back and reseals the vase.
While on this demiplane, you can’t move and are 
blinded, but can hear everything outside of the vase 
as if you were standing in its space. You can leave this 
demiplane using an action to reappear in the nearest 
unoccupied space. When you attempt to leave the 
demiplane, a creature outside the vase can use its 
reaction to hold the vase’s lid shut and make a DC 
25 Strength check, preventing you from leaving on a 
success.
The vase has AC 12, 30 hit points, and is vulnerable 
to bludgeoning damage. The vase is destroyed if it drops 
to 0 hit points. If the vase is destroyed while a creature 
is on its demiplane, that creature is forced into the 
nearest unoccupied space. Once a creature leaves the 
demiplane, the vase’s lid can’t be removed again for 24 
hours.
You can remain on the demiplane for up to 8 hours 
or until the vase is placed inside an extradimensional 
space created by a 
bag of holding
, 
portable hole
, or 
similar item, at which time you are forcefully shunted 
out of it. If the lid is successfully held in place when you 
would be forcefully shunted from the demiplane in this 
way, the vase shatters and is destroyed.
While holding the vase, you can use an action to 
change the style, color, and apparent quality of the 
vessel. The vase’s weight doesn’t change. Regardless of 
its appearance, the vase can’t be anything but a vase.
"
Hoarder’s Haul,"Wondrous item, rarity varies
This magical cart is made from the large, hollow horn 
of a fallen dragon. While all 
hoarder’s hauls
 are made 
from the horns of dragons, their true magic stems from 
the strength of the dragon’s greed. Uncommon and rare 
carts have handles and a single wheel at their front and 
must be physically moved. Very rare versions have a 
flying speed of 10 feet, can hover up to 20 feet off the 
ground, and move according to your spoken directions, 
provided that you are within 30 feet of the cart.
The cart has two command words. The first command 
word can be spoken using an action and causes the cart 
to shrink or enlarge, becoming as small as 1 foot long 
and 7 inches across or as large as 5 feet long and 3 feet 
across. Regardless of its size, the cart always weighs 5 
pounds without anything inside it. Anything contained 
by the cart does not resize to fit its new size, potentially 
spilling onto the ground if the cart becomes too small.
Firell walked through the door to his estate, rifling through 
papers and tucking his jumbling keys back into his purse. 
He idly glances to the side to see a new vase. He stops.
“Jura? Darling? Did you get this vase?”
From somewhere else in the house another voice replied 
back, “No, sweety, it was left for us outside. I think it’s 
from the Hawkins. I’ve sent a messenger there to thank 
them.”
Firell continued to eye the vase, “Ah, that makes sense. 
How nice of them.” He went back to sorting through 
papers. “God awful taste, those Hawkins. What a tacky 
thing.”
The vase suddenly began to wobble. Its lid cracked 
open before shutting once more. Next to the vase stood a 
towering half-orc, sword in hand. He stooped down to look 
at the vase in more detail, “Hmm, well, I don’t think it’s 
tacky. I worked hard to pick out this pattern. Everyone else 
said they liked it, too.”
Firell stared in disbelief, the papers now hanging loosely 
in his hands.
The half-orc stood up, suddenly realizing his error. He 
covered his face with a large hand and slowly dragged it 
down and off his stubbled chin.
The two stared at one another for a long pause.
“Well, this is awkward,” said the half-orc. “Tell you 
what, you give me those keys like I came here for, I leave 
this surprisingly un-tacky vase here, and you tell the 
Hawkins you love their gift. Win-win, right?”
Firell blinked several times, shook his head, and started 
to slowly turn his head and open his mouth. The half-orc 
held up a hand and continued:
“The alternative is I kill you, 
take your keys, and take the pretty 
vase back with me.”
Firell’s mouth closed, his 
shoulders slumped, and reached for 
his keys once more. He held them 
out with trembling fingers.
Satisfied, the half-orc took them. 
“Thank you, that was much easier. 
Now, last thing, I want to hear you 
call the vase beautiful. Make sure to 
sound convincing.”
"
Homeroot,"Wondrous item, rare
This piece of gnarled root has several bulbous openings 
along its twisted length. Enchanted by powerful druids, 
this root has a tiny door and a small, chimney-like 
protrusion from its larger end. While holding it, a tiny 
plume of illusory smoke emanates from the chimney.
You can bury and plant this root in soil over the 
course of 1 minute. If the root remains buried for 1 
hour, it then immediately grows underground to create 
a comfortable, wooden dwelling (provided that there’s 
enough room to grow), and a stump appears from the 
ground where the root was buried. The stump has a 
simple round door carved into it that is large enough 
for a Medium or smaller creature to enter. The door 
appears and opens only at your command, which you 
can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the 
knock
 
spell and similar magic, such as that of a 
chime of 
opening
. The door opens to reveal a tunnel 15 feet deep 
and lined with ladder-like rungs made of twisting roots. 
At the bottom of the tunnel is a large, circular room 
that’s 30 feet in diameter with 10-foot-high ceilings. The 
room is brightly lit by bioluminescent fungi that grow 
along its wooden walls and ceiling. You can magically 
control the light in the room by touching the luminous 
fungi, allowing you to fill the room with total darkness, 
dim light, or bright light.
A single hallway leads away from the room. Four 
doors line the hallway, which each lead to a room 
that’s 10 feet in diameter with a 10-foot-high ceiling. 
Every room is decorated with various pieces of wooden 
furniture made from coiled roots and other magically 
occurring plant growth, such as tables, chairs, or a bed, 
depending on the needs of the creature who planted the 
root.
At the end of the hallway hangs a single red root. 
You can use a bonus action to pull the root to cause 
the hallway to extend upward into a tunnel, complete 
with a root-like ladder, and create a second, temporary 
entrance to the dwelling in an unoccupied space 60 feet 
away from the entrance stump. The temporary entrance 
is well-hidden, noticeable only with a successful DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check, and remains until the start 
of your next turn.
A creature that casts the 
plant growth
 spell as an 
action can redesign the appearance and furniture in 
one of the dwelling’s rooms. If the spell is cast over 
the course of 8 hours, the creature can redesign 
the appearance and furniture of the entire dwelling 
instead, except for the location of the entrance stump. A 
conscious druid or ranger inside the dwelling is aware of 
any Small or larger creature that comes within 60 feet 
of the dwelling’s entrance, and magically knows only the 
creature’s size and gait, such as the gallop of a horse or 
walk of a humanoid.
The entrance stump has 100 hit points, immunity 
to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege 
weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a 
plant growth
 spell cast on the stump can repair it, with 
each casting restoring 10 hit points to it, or all its hit 
points if cast over the course of 8 hours. If the stump is 
destroyed, the dwelling collapses and magically shunts 
anything inside it (other than the furniture) to the 
nearest unoccupied space next to where the root was 
buried. When this happens, the earth magically returns 
to the way it was before the root was buried.
"
Homeward Boots,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
These well-worn boots have an ever-changing arcane 
circle ingrained into their heels. While wearing the 
boots, you can use an action to speak their first 
command word to create an arcane circle, as per the 
teleportation circle
 spell, on the ground below you. The 
circle appears as a trail of dirt or similar muck from 
the bottom of the shoe, and is treated as a permanent 
one for the purposes of this spell. Speaking the first 
command word again destroys the first circle, magically 
cleaning the surface it was placed on, before creating a 
new one at your location.
You can speak the boots’ second command word as 
an action while wearing them to cast the 
teleportation 
circle
 spell, except that this circle is only 5 feet in 
diameter. This circle’s sigil sequence matches the 
one created by the first command word and links 
to its location. When it’s created, the circle appears 
under your feet, centered on your location, and you 
immediately teleport through it. Only a circle created in 
this way can connect to the permanent one created by 
the boots’ first command word. If the permanent circle is 
washed away or otherwise cleaned or destroyed before 
you speak the second command word, the spell fails and 
the circle isn’t created.
Once you use the boots to teleport in this way, they 
can’t do so again until 1d3 days have passed. In the 
meantime, you can still speak the boots’ first command 
word.
"
Horatio’s Impossible Ship in a Bottle,"Wondrous item, rare
This sea-tumbled glass bottle has a miniature sailing 
ship assembled inside it. The bottle weighs 1 pound and 
is magically sealed with red wax. Despite there being 
no wind in the bottle, the vessel’s sails seemingly billow 
and turn on their own.
You can speak the bottle’s command word to cause the 
wax to come apart and open the bottle. When the open 
bottle is submerged in a large enough body of water, 
the ship inside it magically slips out, destroying the 
bottle, and becomes a sailing ship 50 feet long and 15 
feet wide. A crew of 10 
unseen servants
 remain on the 
ship at all times and can be commanded by you or any 
creature that is friendly to you while on board to adjust 
the ship’s sails and direction. The ship’s reduced size 
halves the vessel’s normal creature and cargo capacity, 
but is otherwise treated as if it were a normal sailing 
ship.
If you keep a similarly sized glass bottle aboard the 
vessel, the ship and its unseen crew magically reduce 
in size and appear inside the newly sealed bottle when 
the ship is run aground. The bottle must have been 
submerged in the ocean for at least 10 years, and 
anything onboard the ship when it is resealed falls to the 
water or ground below.
"
Horn of the Wild Hunt,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This large, spiraling warhorn has 3 charges and 
regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can 
use an action to expend 1 charge and blow the horn, 
summoning a war elk as if you had cast the 
find steed
 
spell. A war elk uses the same statistics as a giant elk 
with the following changes: its size is Large, it has AC 
14 (hide barding), and has 37 hit points. The steed 
disappears if your attunement to the horn ends.
Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 1 of 
the horn’s charges to speak its command word and then 
blow the horn. When you do, a spectral stampede of elk 
trample the area in a line 60 feet long and 15 feet wide 
that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each 
creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 force 
damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a 
creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked 
prone.
When you blow the horn, it emits a deep, rumbling 
tone that is audible 300 feet away.
When a crew brings up a wreck, it is the captain who has first choice of the 
salvage. And Ironbrace always chose moldering bottles and shards of aging 
timber; “to give the old hulks new life,” he said, as the walls of his cabin grew 
lined with perished ships in miniature, each in its own glass sepulchre.
And, when one of his crew felt a call to leave the sea, each went with a ship 
from the precious collection. For the sea might call them back again, and his 
charges would not be found wanting.
"
Hour and Minute,"Weapon (dagger and shortsword), very rare (requires 
attunement)
These two magical weapons are bound by a powerful 
force. Despite there being two weapons, you only need 
to attune to one of them to use their properties. While 
holding one of the weapons, you can use an action 
to determine the distance and direction of the other 
paired weapon as long as you’re on the same plane of 
existence.
If you attune to one of the weapons while another 
creature is attuned to the other, you are each aware 
of the other creature’s attunement and must make an 
Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other 
creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The creature 
that wins the contest remains attuned to the item, and 
for the next 24 hours, its attunement cannot be broken 
by another creature attempting to attune to the other 
weapon. The creature that loses the contest is no longer 
attuned to the weapon.
While holding both weapons in either hand, you gain 
several benefits:
 
y
 You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with these magic weapons.
 
y
 Your perception of time is slightly quickened: 
allowing you to dodge attacks that would have 
normally hit you. You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
 
y
 When you roll a 20 on an attack roll using 
Hour
 
(the dagger) against a creature, that creature is 
subjected to the effect of the 
slow
 spell until the end 
of your next turn.
 
y
 When you roll a 20 on an attack roll using 
Minute
 
(the shortsword), you gain the effect of the 
haste
 
spell until the start of your next turn. When the 
effect ends, you don’t suffer the normal effects of the 
spell ending.
 
y
 In addition, you can use an action to lay the two 
weapons down on the ground. When you do, they 
magically point north before spinning around to 
align and tell the current time. When they do, 12:00 
is always facing north.
"
Hourglass of Slumber,"Wondrous item, very rare
This ebony and gold hourglass is filled with nebulous 
clouds of dreamy smoke instead of sand. The hourglass 
can act as a 1-minute timer, allowing the smoke to filter 
from one chamber to the next for the duration.
The hourglass has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expend-
ed charges daily at dusk. While holding it, you can ex-
pend 1 or more of the glass’s charges to turn it over and 
cast the 
sleep
 spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 
3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell 
slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. 
This version of the spell has the following changes:
 
y
 The spell lasts until the hourglass’s timer ends or is 
stopped, or until the hourglass is flipped again.
 
y
 Each time a sleeping creature takes damage, it 
must make a Constitution saving throw, waking 
up on a success. The DC is equal to 20 minus half 
the damage dealt (minimum DC 10). After 3 failed 
saves, a creature automatically wakes up.
"
Hushed Ring,"Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)
This ring creates an arcane field around you that 
prevents certain modes of communication. While 
wearing this ring, you cannot be spoken to telepathically 
by creatures other than the ones you choose.
In addition, while wearing this ring, you can use an 
action to speak this ring’s command word to create an 
aura of silence around you. The aura affects creatures 
other than yourself within 10 feet of you. It remains as 
long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), 
to a maximum of 1 minute. For the duration, when a 
creature within the aura attempts to speak or utter the 
verbal components of a spell, it must make a DC 13 
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is 
unable to speak or produce the verbal components of 
a spell until the start of its next turn, and any action, 
bonus action, or reaction it used to do so is wasted. This 
property of the ring can’t be used again until the next 
dusk.
"
Hydra Charm,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This golden talisman is made of five twisting hydra 
heads and hung from a simple gold chain. While 
wearing this talisman, you gain the following benefits:
 
y
 When you use your reaction to make an opportunity 
attack, you can make a second attack against that 
same target as part of that reaction.
 
y
 You can make an opportunity attack, even if you’ve 
already used your reaction.
 
y
 When you are forced to make a saving throw against 
being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, 
stunned, or knocked unconscious, you can use your 
reaction to make the saving throw with advantage.
 
y
 When you take more than 25 damage from a single 
attack or effect, you can use your reaction to regain 
10 hit points. If this damage would reduce you to 0 
hit points but not kill you outright, you drop to 1 hit 
point instead and do not regain 10 hit points.
 
y
 When your head would be cut off by an effect, such 
as by a 
vorpal sword
, you can use your reaction to 
negate the effect.
Once a benefit of the talisman has been used, that 
benefit can’t be used again until you finish a long rest.
"
Hydra Flail,"Weapon (flail), rare
This flail’s spiked head is held in the jaws of a metal 
hydra figurehead. Whenever you score a critical hit 
with this weapon against a hostile creature, the weapon 
magically grows another spiked head. You gain a +2 
bonus to damage rolls made with this magic weapon 
for each head the flail has (to a maximum of +6). After 
1 hour, any head the flail grows in this way falls off and 
disappears.
"
Impact Plate,"Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)
This resilient plate mail was made by dwarves but 
magically resizes to fit the wearer’s stature. While 
wearing it, you have resistance to bludgeoning damage, 
and you don’t take any falling damage when you fall no 
farther than 100 feet.
"
Indigo Stray’s Conviction,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This set of midnight-colored gloves effervesce with 
slow wisps of smoke, and were famously worn by a 
royal assassin who had been freed of their bindings. 
"
Infernal Chain,"Weapon (flail), very rare (requires attunement)
This length of heavy chain has a weight at its end and 
is always warm to the touch. The chain is 10 feet long 
and weighs 10 pounds. When you attune to the chain, 
it magically coils up one of your arms (your choice) and 
secures itself in place. When you swing it, the chain 
"
Inker’s Armband,"Wondrous item, common
This brushed metal bracelet is lined with a magical 
black ink. The ink only stains skin and slides harmlessly 
off of clothing. While wearing the bracelet, you can use 
a bonus action to cause magical tattoos to appear on 
the arm that’s wearing it. The tattoos remain until you 
remove the bracelet or use a bonus action to end the 
effect or change their appearance. These tattoos can 
either be still or magically animated in a slow loop that 
repeats every 6 seconds. Regardless of the tattoo, the 
armband only produces black ink.
"
Insatiable Tome,"Wondrous item, rare
This large, ragged tome weighs 12 pounds and has 
up to one thousand blank vellum pages inside it. The 
tome is magical and devours any smaller nonmagical 
book or document placed next to it with rows of hidden 
teeth over the course of 1 minute. After the tome has 
eaten a book, you can use an action to speak the tome’s 
command word, followed by the name of a book or 
document it’s eaten, to cause the previously destroyed 
contents to appear on the blank pages of the book. The 
contents are magically printed on the tome’s pages in 
the same language or cipher they were originally written 
in and remain until you speak the tome’s command 
word again to erase them or replace them with another 
document’s contents.
The tome dislikes the taste of magic. Any swallowed 
pages containing spells, magical sigils, or arcane scrolls 
are harmlessly spat back out by the tome. However, 
any notes, spells, or magical sigils that are written 
in the tome (instead of having been eaten by it) can 
be recalled if they’re either dated, labeled, or titled. 
Written commentary, notes, and other such addenda to 
documents within the tome are saved by it and appear 
whenever the document is recalled again.
"
Inspector’s Silverware,"Wondrous item, common
This array of polished magic silverware typically comes 
in sets of three pieces of cutlery: a knife, a spoon, and a 
fork. Each piece of cutlery has 1 charge. When a piece 
of cutlery that has a charge comes into contact with 
a food or drink that’s poisonous (either naturally or 
magically), it loses its charge and immediately begins to 
tarnish and corrode. A piece of tarnished cutlery regains 
its expended charge and becomes polished again when 
a creature holding it is targeted by a 
lesser restoration
 
spell or similar magic. If a creature is holding multiple 
pieces of this cutlery when targeted by the spell, only 
one of them regains an expended charge.
"
Instrument of Roses and Thorns,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a bard)
This string instrument is ornamented with rose and 
thorn designs. Whenever you use this instrument to 
give a Bardic Inspiration die to a creature, you can 
also choose to force another creature within 60 feet 
of you that can hear you to make a Charisma saving 
throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the 
creature gains an Enervation die, which remains for 1 
minute or until it’s rolled. When a creature with one or 
more Enervation dice that you can see makes an ability 
check or attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll 
any number of its Enervation dice, which are the same 
as your Bardic Inspiration dice, and subtract the result 
from the total of the roll. The Enervation dice are then 
lost. You can wait to use this reaction until after the 
creature rolls the d20, but must decide before the GM 
says whether the roll succeeds or fails. If the total of the 
roll is reduced to 0 or lower as a result of the Enervation 
die, the creature also takes 6d6 necrotic damage.
A creature that attempts to play the instrument 
without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 16 
Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 necrotic damage.
"
Ironleaf Impaler,"Weapon (javelin or spear), rare (requires attunement)
This wooden weapon is sprouted from a roughly fist-
sized seed that’s still attached to its base. A large, red 
thorn creates the weapon’s pointed tip. Dense, thorny 
vines coil around the top and bottom of the haft, with 
small, glowing splits appearing in the wood beneath 
them. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon.
In addition, this weapon has 5 charges and regains 
all expended charges daily at dawn. When you make 
a ranged attack with the weapon, you can choose 
to expend 1 of its charges. Hit or miss, the weapon 
explodes into thorny shrapnel after it reaches the target. 
The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must 
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creatures 
takes 1d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. If the target was hit 
by the attack, it automatically fails the saving throw. 
Immediately after the weapon explodes, the seed 
reappears at your location and regrows the weapon into 
your hand.
"
Jo’Catian Denier,"Weapon (longsword, scimitar, or shortsword), uncommon 
(requires attunement by a creature of neutral alignment)
This magic weapon comes from a clan of sentient 
wurms that debilitate their foes with strange magic. This 
sword has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges 
daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with the sword, 
you can expend 1 of its charges as part of the attack to 
force that creature to make a DC 13 saving throw of 
your choice. On a failed save, a creature is subjected to 
an effect based on the kind of saving throw it made:
 
y
 Strength. 
The creature gains a –2 penalty to attack 
rolls until the end of its next turn.
 
y
 Dexterity. 
The creature’s movement speed is halved 
until the end of its next turn.
 
y
 Constitution. 
If the creature is Large or smaller, it 
loses its balance and is pushed 15 feet away from 
you.
 
y
 Intelligence. 
The creature has disadvantage on the 
next spell attack it makes within 1 minute.
 
y
 Wisdom. 
The creature becomes slightly sluggish 
and can’t take reactions until the end of its next 
turn.
 
y
 Charisma. 
The creature has disadvantage on 
attacks against creatures other than you until the 
end of its next turn.
Wiggling Charges.
 While you’re attuned to this 
weapon as well as the 
Jo’Catian rebuker
, you can 
use charges from either item to fuel this weapon’s 
properties.
"
Jo’Catian Rebuker,"Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement by a 
creature of neutral alignment)
This magic shield is forged by a mysterious group of 
sentient wurms whose work is prized for its craftiness. 
This shield has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. When you take damage from 
a creature you can see within 30 feet of you and are 
holding the shield, you can expend 1 of its charges as a 
reaction to reduce the damage you take by 1d6. When 
you do, you can also choose an ability. Until the end of 
its next turn, that creature magically has disadvantage 
on the next saving throw it makes of the chosen ability.
Once a creature has been affected by this property, it 
can’t be affected by it again for 1 minute.
Wiggling Charges.
 While you’re attuned to this shield 
as well as the 
Jo’Catian denier
, you can use charges 
from either item to fuel this shield’s properties.
"
Kestra’s Bent Spoon,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This silver spoon once belonged to a mystic with an 
unending appetite. It has three runes etched into the 
metal that perform various magical functions.
 
y
 Ulm
, in the bowl of the spoon, enhances the 
flavor of any soup or similarly spoonable dish by 
drawing out the more nuanced flavors that are often 
overlooked.
 
y
 Tox
, on the back of the spoon’s head, causes the 
spoon to tarnish and dim when touched by a poison. 
The spoon remains this way until the next dawn, 
when its normal luster magically reappears.
 
y
 Seera
, on the handle, strengthens the power of 
certain psychic effects. While the spoon is on your 
person and you roll psychic damage, you can focus 
your attention on the spoon (no action required) to 
deal maximum damage on one of the damage dice. 
Once this rune has been used, it can’t be used again 
until the next dawn.
"
Ki Blade,"Weapon (shortsword), very rare (requires attunement by a 
monk)
This gently curved blade resonates with the force of 
your ki. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon, and while you’re attuned 
to it, your ki point maximum increases by 2.
When you use your Deflect Missiles feature and are 
holding the 
ki blade
, you can choose to use the weapon 
to attack the missile instead of capturing it. If you do, 
the damage you take from the ranged attack is reduced 
by an extra 1d10. If you reduce the damage to 0, the 
missile is destroyed unless it was magical, in which case 
it clatters to the ground at your feet. Once you use this 
property, you can spend 1 ki point to use your Deflect 
Missiles feature again on the same turn, potentially 
destroying multiple missiles from the same attacker.
"
Kinetic Bowstring,"Wondrous item, rare
This magic bowstring can be used to string a 
nonmagical bow or crossbow, turning any attack made 
with it into a magical one. A 
kinetic bowstring
 magically 
amplifies some of the stored kinetic force that it releases 
when it fires an arrow or bolt. The first ranged attack 
you make on each of your turns using a weapon strung 
with this item has twice its normal range, and on a hit, 
the attack deals one extra die of its damage.
"
Kraken Band,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This metal sculpture of a tentacle coils around your 
arm as part of attuning to it. While you’re attuned to the 
band, it can’t be removed against your will, and you can 
magically transform the arm wearing it into a lashing 
tentacle as part of your attacks. When you take the 
Attack action, you can use your bonus action to make an 
unarmed strike using this tentacle, which has a reach 
of 15 feet. On a hit, the tentacle deals an extra 1d6 acid 
damage. When you attempt to grapple a creature on 
your turn as part of the Attack action, you can use the 
tentacle to target a creature within 15 feet of you that 
you can see, instead of within your normal reach. On a 
successful grapple, the creature takes 1d6 acid damage 
and is pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you.
The call of the sea can be an emotional one for some. It 
pulls you towards its gentle tides and salt-sprayed air like 
a siren. For others, the ocean simply reaches out a tentacle 
and pulls you in.
"
Lady Phantasma’s Material Anchor,"Wondrous item, very rare
This small and rusted anchor charm is bound to a 
famous, lost ship: the 
Lady Phantasma
. This ship and 
its crew was lost to the Ethereal Plane centuries ago, 
cursed to remain there for all eternity as punishment for 
stealing a powerful sea hag’s treasured relic. However, 
this small charm can act as the ship’s sole remaining 
tether to the Material Plane.
As an action, you can call out to the ship while holding 
the charm aloft. If you’re within 30 feet of a body of 
water on the Material Plane, a full-sized anchor appears 
on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of 
the water. A wispy, green chain appears on the anchor 
that extends into nothingness for 1 minute. At the end 
of the minute, the 
Lady Phantasma
 emerges from the 
Ethereal Plane, pulled by the anchor’s chain, and comes 
to rest in the water nearby. The ship is a longship 70 
feet long and 20 feet wide. It’s piloted by thirty-four 
crewmembers and five officers, all of whom are long-
dead, ghostly remains of their former selves. They are 
formless and harmless, but are nevertheless visible and 
friendly to you and your companions. They can interact 
with the rigging, sails, and other equipment on the ship, 
but nothing else while they remain on the Material 
Plane. While the ship remains, you are considered the 
captain of the vessel while the charm is on your person.
At dawn, the ship’s crew is shunted back to the 
Ethereal Plane, leaving the ship behind, until the 
following dusk when they reappear on the vessel once 
more. The ship’s anchor is immovable while the crew 
is on the Ethereal Plane, holding the ship in place until 
they return each night. While the ship can move, it 
moves at a speed of 10 miles per hour, even when there 
isn’t any wind.
If the charm is removed from the 
Lady Phantasma
 
for 24 hours, the ship and its crew vanish and return to 
the Ethereal Plane until they’re summoned again. You 
can speak the charm’s command phrase “Until the tides 
call once more,” to cause the ship and crew to return to 
the Ethereal Plane early. Any objects on the ship other 
than what was there when it came from the Ethereal 
Plane are dropped into the water below the ship when it 
disappears. If the ship is destroyed while on the Material 
Plane, the charm is destroyed and turns to flecks of 
nonmagical rust.
"
Lamian Facestealer,"Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement)
This dagger once belonged to an infamous lamian 
assassin and features a sculpted metal face at the base 
of the blade. When you attune to this weapon, the metal 
face magically changes to match your appearance. You 
gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
this magic weapon.
The dagger has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dusk. When you hit a humanoid 
with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to 
immediately recreate the effect of the 
disguise self
 spell 
(save DC 15), taking on the appearance of the target. 
When you do, the dagger’s metal face changes to match 
the appearance. This version of the spell allows you to 
seem up to 3 feet shorter or taller when taking on the 
target’s appearance.
When you take on a creature’s appearance in this way, 
that creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. 
On a failed save, that creature has disadvantage on Wis-
dom saving throws and all ability checks as long as it 
can see you while you share its appearance in this way.
"
Lash of the Spelldrinker,"Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. While attuned to this whip, 
you are considered proficient with it and can use it 
as a spellcasting focus. In addition, you can use your 
spellcasting ability modifier for any attack or damage 
roll made with it, instead of Strength or Dexterity.
When a hostile creature within the whip’s reach casts 
a spell, you can use your reaction to make a weapon 
attack against that creature with the whip. On a hit, the 
target must make a saving throw using its spellcasting 
ability against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you 
learn the level of the creature’s highest remaining spell 
slot, and the creature takes extra force damage equal to 
that number.
When a creature takes force damage from the whip in 
this way, you can choose to recover an expended spell 
slot of a level equal to or less than the force damage 
dealt, up to 3rd level. Once the whip has been used to 
recover a spell slot in this way, it can’t do so again until 
the next dusk.
"
Leatherbeard,"Wondrous item, common
This leather mask sits over your mouth and chin and 
can be worn or removed using an action. While wearing 
the mask, you grow an illusory beard. You choose the 
color and style of the beard each time you wear the 
mask. The beard can be up to 2 feet long. A DC 10 
Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the beard is an 
illusion.
For every 7 consecutive days that pass in which you do 
not remove the mask, there is a cumulative 25 percent 
chance that the beard becomes real. When it does, the 
mask is destroyed. The real beard doesn’t continue to 
grow unless you can already naturally grow a beard.
"
Life Tether Ankh,"Wondrous item, uncommon
While wearing this necklace, you can choose to succeed 
on a death saving throw you would have otherwise failed 
(no action required). Once the ankh has been used 
to succeed on a death saving throw, it shatters and is 
destroyed.
If you use the ankh when you would normally suffer 
two failed death saving throws, you instead gain one 
success and one failure. If this would cause you to have 
3 successful death saving throws as well as 3 failed 
ones, roll a final death saving throw. On a success, you 
stabilize. On a failure, you die.
"
Life Turner,"Wondrous item, legendary
This tiny, spinning hourglass has six seconds’ worth 
of sand inside it and can be easily held or worn as a 
pendant. When a creature that you can see within 120 
feet of you dies, you can use your reaction to speak the 
hourglass’s command word and spin it, allowing you to 
immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current 
turn. At the end of your turn, the dead creature returns 
to life with a number of hit points equal to your current 
hit point total (up to its hit point maximum), and you die. 
If the dead creature was prone, it can immediately stand 
up (no action required). Once this property has been 
used, it can’t be used again until 1 year has passed.
When you die as a result of using the hourglass, your 
body is enchanted by protective magic for 3 hours. 
During this time, if a spell, such as 
raise dead
, has the 
sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the 
caster doesn’t need material components to cast the 
spell on you. In addition, while you’re protected by this 
magic, you are also under the effect of the 
gentle repose
 
spell.
"
Life’s Flower Restorative,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a creature 
missing a hand, arm, or leg)
This vital branch pulses with life and resembles a crude 
limb. To attune to this item, you must attach it to the end 
of your missing arm or leg, at which point the branch 
magically forms an elegant copy of the appendage it’s 
replacing. This prosthetic is a fully capable part of your 
"
Light Sling,"Weapon (sling), common
As an action, you can speak this magic sling’s command 
word and hurl a tiny ball of light at a point or target you 
can see within 30 feet of you. The ball of light sheds 
bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an 
additional 20 feet. On a hit, the ball deals no damage 
and sticks to the target for up to 1 minute, until the sling 
is used to hurl another ball of light, or until a creature 
within reach of the light uses its action to snuff it out 
(as if snuffing out a candle). If the target is an unwilling 
creature or an object being worn or carried by one, 
the creature must also make a DC 10 Dexterity saving 
throw. On a failed save, the ball sticks to the target 
for the duration. On a successful save, the ball of light 
winks out.
"
Lightning Khopesh,"Weapon (scimitar), rare
This bolt-like blade crackles with electric energy. When 
you hit with an attack using this magic weapon, the 
target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage. In addition, 
the first time you have advantage on an attack roll and 
miss using this weapon on each of your turns, the target 
takes 1d6 lightning damage as stray sparks leap from 
the blade to shock the target.
"
Lightscreen Hover Boots,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
These hefty boots are miraculously light to walk in. As 
a bonus action, you can click your heels together while 
wearing the boots to hover 1 foot off the floor. You can 
move as normal while hovering in this way using your 
walking speed, skating above the ground on a plume of 
blue light. The light sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius 
and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
As an action, you can speak the boots’ command word 
to cause their light to shine brighter, emitting bright 
light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for another 40 
feet until the end of your turn. As part of this action, 
you can immediately move up to your walking speed 
across any horizontal or vertical surface, including 
walls or upside down along ceilings. This movement 
doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks and leaves a trail 
of blue light behind you. At the end of this movement, 
the trail of light solidifies, becoming a radiant blue wall 
that extends perpendicularly from the surface on which 
you moved, excluding your current space. The wall is 
translucent, 1/4 inch thick, and up to 10 feet tall. If the 
wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the 
creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice 
which side).
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is 
immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by 
dispel 
magic
. A 
disintegrate
 spell destroys the wall instantly, 
however.
The wall lasts until the start of your next turn. Once 
you use this property, it can’t be used again for 1d4 
hours.
"
Lightseer’s Gaze,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a monk)
This flourished mask obscures your eyes and magically 
stays in place while worn. It once belonged to a wise 
spiritual leader whose name has been lost to time, 
but was said to have eschewed personal belongings. 
While wearing the mask and attuned to it, you gain the 
following benefits:
 
y
 You have blindsight out to a range of 120 feet, and 
truesight out to a range of 60 feet. You are blind 
beyond this radius. Despite being blind, you can still 
see the moon, stars, and sun when they’re in the sky 
above you.
 
y
 Your Wisdom score changes to 21. This property 
has no effect on you if your Wisdom is already 21 or 
higher without the mask.
 
y
 You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks.
 
y
 You can spend 3 ki points as an action to cast the 
spirit guardians
 spell (save DC 16).
 
y
 You can use an action to spend 2 ki points to cast 
the 
calm emotions
 spell (save DC 16). Alternatively, 
if you speak to a hostile creature for 1 minute, it 
must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or 
become indifferent about creatures of your choice 
that it is hostile toward, as if affected by the 
calm 
emotions
 spell (no concentration required). If a 
creature succeeds on the saving throw in this way, 
it’s immune to the effects of this property for 24 
hours.
Curse.
 This item is cursed, and attuning to it extends 
that curse to you. You can’t remove the mask while 
cursed in this way. You remain cursed until it’s ended by 
a 
wish
 spell or similar magic. When you become cursed, 
your name remains known to only you but becomes 
lost to the rest of the universe, at the GM’s discretion. 
You must choose a new name. This new name replaces 
every instance of your lost name throughout history, 
and becomes the only known name for you among all 
creatures who once knew your lost name. While cursed, 
you take 5d10 psychic damage whenever you attempt to 
speak, write, or otherwise share or communicate your 
lost name. Regardless of how you attempt to share the 
lost name, it always comes across as your new one.
"
Locket of the Stolen Heart,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
The portrait inside this tiny golden locket transforms to 
depict the creature you love most (living or dead) once 
you attune to it. The love can be familial, romantic, or 
otherwise devotional. If your feelings change and you 
fall in love with a different creature while wearing the 
locket, the portrait transforms again to reflect your cur-
rent feelings. While wearing the locket, you’re immune 
to being charmed.
Curse.
 This locket is cursed, and if the creature you 
love most is dead while you’re attuned to it, the curse 
is extended to you. Even if the attunement ends or the 
target of your love changes, the curse remains. While 
cursed, your dreams are riddled with forlorn whispers 
and memories from your lost love. If you die while 
cursed in this way, you must also make a DC 13 Wisdom 
saving throw whenever you’re targeted by a spell or oth-
er effect that returns you to life. On a failed save, your 
soul is lost forever as it joins the soul of your lost love.
You remain cursed until you’re targeted by the 
greater 
restoration
 or 
remove curse
 spell, if the creature you 
love is restored to life, or if a creature casts the 
dream
 
spell and enters your dreams to dissolve the locket’s 
illusions.
"
Luckleaf,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This plant is commonly thought to be a special kind of 
clover. However, a 
luckleaf
 is a separate, magical species 
that grows in random locations across the Material 
Plane and has 5 leaves. While a 
luckleaf
 is on your 
person, you can choose to expend any number of its 
leaves (no action required). When you do so, you gain a 
+1 bonus or take a –1 penalty to any roll you make for 
each expended leaf. This bonus or penalty can’t change 
the total result beyond the highest or lowest number 
possible for the die you rolled. You can wait to use this 
property until after seeing the total of the roll, but before 
the GM determines the outcome of it. An expended 
leaf withers and turns to dust. When the last leaf is 
expended, the plant becomes a nonmagical stem.
"
Luna Moth Cape,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This beautiful elven cape is fashioned after the wings of 
a luna moth. While wearing the cape, you can move an 
extra 10 feet when you take the Dash action.
In addition, while wearing this cape, you can speak 
its command word as a bonus action when you jump to 
cause it to unfurl and flap downwards, sending you 10 
feet into the air when you reach the height of your jump. 
This property can’t be used again until you land on solid 
ground.
"
Lupine Mask,"Wondrous item, uncommon
While wearing this dark ceramic mask, you have 
advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying 
on hearing and smell, as well as on Wisdom (Animal 
Handling) checks made to interact with dogs and dog-
like beasts, such as foxes, jackals, and wolves.
"
Mace of the Priest,"Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement by a cleric)
This magic mace is carried by priests and is a symbol of 
their devotion to ridding the world of evil. While holding 
it, you can use a bonus action to adjust its telescoping 
haft, changing it from a mace to a quarterstaff, and vice 
versa. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon.
The weapon has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended 
charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use 
an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast either 
cure 
wounds
 (3rd-level version) or 
dispel magic
 from it, using 
your spellcasting ability modifier.
Alternatively, you can use an action to speak the 
weapon’s command word to cast the 
heal
 spell from it. 
When you do, the weapon releases a flash of light and is 
destroyed.
"
Mace of the Pumpkin King,"Weapon (mace), uncommon
This magic mace is actually an enchanted pumpkin 
whose stem is used as a handle. Its orange exterior is 
carved into a frightening visage with a toothy maw and 
unforgiving eyes. Between dusk and dawn, the pumpkin 
is lit from within with a magical flame that sheds bright 
light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 
20 feet. While the flame is lit, targets hit by the mace 
take an extra 1d4 fire damage, and when you roll a 20 
on an attack roll with the flaming weapon, the target 
must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be 
frightened of you until the start of your next turn.
"
Mage Eater Scythe,"Weapon (glaive), legendary (requires attunement)
This dark metal scythe bears a fiendish grin along its 
blade. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. While holding the scythe, 
you have advantage on saving throws against spells and 
other magical effects.
When you hit a creature with an attack using this 
scythe, you can spend 2 or more Hit Dice (maximum 
4) to deal extra necrotic damage, in addition to the 
weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 1d6 for each 
Hit Die you spend. If the creature has cast a spell since 
the end of your last turn, the extra damage dice become 
d10s, instead of d6s, and that creature loses a total 
number of spell slot levels equal to the number of Hit 
Dice you spend. Starting with the highest spell slot level 
that creature has (up to 4th), subtract each slot level 
from the total, if possible, before moving on to the next 
remaining spell slot level.
Alternatively, while holding the scythe, you can use an 
action to spend 5 Hit Dice to create a magical barrier 
around yourself. While the barrier exists, you can’t be 
affected or detected by spells of 5th level or lower unless 
you choose to be, and friendly creatures within 10 feet 
of you have advantage of saving throws against spells 
and other magical effects. The barrier remains as long 
as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to 
a maximum of 1 minute, or until you drop or stow the 
scythe.
"
Magebane Poison,"Potion, very rare
This dark, bubbling poison is made from a rakshasa’s 
magic-immune blood and tastes sweet and syrupy, 
despite its gruesome appearance. Each bottle contains 
one dose of the poison. A creature that ingests this 
poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. 
On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 poison damage 
and is poisoned for 1 hour. If the poisoned creature 
is a spellcaster, it takes an additional 4d6 psychic 
damage and can’t cast cantrips until this poison ends. 
In addition, a poisoned spellcaster can only cast spells 
of 1st level or higher by using a spell slot at least 4 
levels higher than the desired slot level, without the 
added benefits of using the higher spell slot level. For 
example, a poisoned spellcaster can cast the 2nd-level 
version of 
magic missile
 using a 6th-level spell slot. On 
a successful save, a creature takes half as much poison 
and psychic damage and isn’t poisoned.
"
Magentan Sun-Saw,"Weapon (scimitar), rarity varies (requires attunement)
The typical 
magentan sun-saw
, an uncommon item, is 
a falchion with a curved metal guard that protects your 
hand. The sword has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 
expended charges daily at dawn.
When you hit a target with this magic sword, you can 
expend 1 of its charges as part of the attack to reach 
your fingers around the weapon’s curved guard and pull 
it like a trigger. When you do, a line of whirring blades 
of light springs from the weapon’s edge and rips around 
the length of the sword, rending and tearing into the 
target to deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage to it. The 
light is a vibrant magenta.
The following 
magentan sun-saw
 is a very rare variant 
with more powerful properties. You gain a +2 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 
In addition, when you expend 1 of the weapon’s charges 
when you hit with an attack, the light is sunlight (albeit 
still magenta in color) and deals an extra 2d6 radiant 
damage to the target, instead of 1d6. If the target has 
the Sunlight Sensitivity or Sunlight Hypersensitivity 
trait, such as a drow or vampire, it’s considered to be in 
sunlight until the end of its next turn.
"
Mageplate Ring,"Ring, rare (requires attunement)
This thin iron ring has a helm-like visor at its top. The 
ring has 3 charges and regains all expended charges 
daily at dawn. While wearing this ring, you can use a 
bonus action to expend 1 or more charges from it to 
become magically protected by an illusory set of spectral 
armor. For 1 charge, your base AC becomes 16 (your 
Dexterity modifier doesn’t affect this number). You can 
increase this base AC by 1 for each additional charge 
you expend. The illusory armor lasts for 1 minute and 
sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for 
another 20 feet for the duration.
"
Magnificent Pocket Vanity,"Wondrous item, common
This palm-sized brass device contains enough magical 
makeup for 3 uses. A creature holding the vanity can use 
an action to expend 1 of its uses to apply the makeup to 
itself or another willing creature within reach, at which 
point the creature’s appearance magically changes to 
one of the following forms, as if by the 
disguise self
 
spell (save DC 13). This version of the spell can visually 
alter a creature’s height by up to 5 feet, although the 
creature’s size does not change, and you roll on the 
table below to determine which random appearance the 
creature assumes:
d6
Random Appearance
1
A hunched-over elderly gnomish woman with 
graying hair, missing teeth, and wearing a 
ragged, faded dress.
2
An intimidating half-orc man with deep green 
skin, black hair pulled back in a bun, and 
battle-worn hide armor.
3
A regal and androgynous elf with a tan 
complexion and golden hair wearing fine 
leathers and a shimmering cape of red and 
silver.
4
A dust-covered human boy of no more than 13 
years with messy blonde hair wearing a flimsy 
cap and half-torn overalls.
5
A strikingly red tiefling woman with white 
hair wearing silver plate armor and wielding a 
polished longsword.
6
A bald, dwarven man with a peg leg and scar-
covered face wearing the garb of a well-traveled 
sailor.
When the last use of the makeup has been used, the 
vanity and its makeup become nonmagical.
"
Mandible Bident,"Weapon (trident), uncommon (requires attunement)
This chitinous, two-pronged weapon still shudders with 
predatory instinct, magically biting down on creatures it 
hits. Once on each of your turns when you hit a Medium 
or smaller creature with this magic bident with a melee 
attack, you can force that creature to make a DC 13 
Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a 
failed save, the creature is grappled by you and is held 
in place by the weapon. A creature can use its action to 
make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another 
creature within its reach from this grapple on a success. 
You can’t use the weapon to attack another target 
while it’s grappling a creature in this way, but you can 
choose to deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage to the grappled 
creature automatically in place of any attack you’d make 
with it as part of the Attack action, as the weapon’s 
pincers clamp down tightly around the target.
You can release a creature from the bident’s grapple 
on your turn (no action required). The weapon releases 
a creature from its grasp early if you let go of the 
weapon or are incapacitated.
"
Mantle of Security,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This soft cloak was once a child’s beloved blanket and 
has been miraculously enchanted by their hopes and 
dreams. While worn as a cloak, you can’t be frightened, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep. When unclasped, it can 
still be used as a warm blanket. When used as a blanket 
while sleeping or over the course of a short or long rest, 
you can’t be unwillingly targeted by the 
dream
 spell, you 
gain a +3 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) 
score, and you can’t be surprised as a result of being 
unconscious. Regardless of how the cloak is used, 
you can tolerate temperatures as low as −50 degrees 
Fahrenheit without any additional protection.
"
Marlin Lunger,"Weapon (rapier), uncommon (requires attunement)
This rapier allows you to sail through the water to 
pierce your foes. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and you 
don’t suffer the negative effects of underwater fighting 
when you make an attack with it. Once on each of your 
turns when you attack with this rapier while underwater, 
you can glide up to 15 feet through the water, as part of 
that action, immediately before or after the attack.
"
Masks of the Sacred Beasts,"Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)
These dark ceramic and gold masks are fashioned after 
animals that are sacred in certain cultures. Each mask’s 
appearance and properties are based on the sacred 
beast it represents. While attuned to a mask, you can 
end your attunement to it and attune to a different one 
over the course of 1 minute, instead of over the course 
of one or more short rests.
Crocodile (Common).
 While wearing a crocodile 
mask, you gain a swimming speed of 30 feet and can 
hold your breath for up to 10 minutes at a time.
Lion (Uncommon).
 While wearing a lion mask, 
you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
that rely on smell. In addition, your nails extend into 
claws, turning your unarmed strikes with your hands 
into magic weapons that deal slashing damage with a 
damage die of 1d6.
Hawk (Rare).
 While wearing a hawk mask, you have 
advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely 
on sight, and attacking at long range doesn’t impose 
disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls. In addition, 
you can cast the 
feather fall
 spell at will, targeting only 
yourself.
Mule (Very Rare).
 While wearing a mule mask, your 
Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, you 
count as one size larger when determining your carrying 
capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift, and 
you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity ability 
checks and saving throws against being knocked prone. 
In addition, when you hit a Large or smaller creature 
with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action 
to force that creature to make a DC 16 Strength or 
Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, the 
creature is knocked prone.
Jackal (Legendary).
 While wearing a jackal mask, 
you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and 
immunity to necrotic damage.
In addition, you can use an action to fire a beam of 
deathly green magic from your forehead at a creature 
you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must 
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 
30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. Once this property of the 
mask has been used, it can’t be used again until the next 
dusk.
A humanoid killed by this necrotic damage rises at the 
start of your next turn as a mummy under your control. 
The mummy acts on its own initiative count. On your 
turn, you can mentally command the mummy if it is 
within 120 feet of you and you aren’t incapacitated (no 
action required). You decide what action the mummy 
"
Matron’s Mug,"Wondrous item, very rare
This rustic stoneware mug is warm to the touch and 
exudes a feeling of comfort while held. You can speak its 
command word as an action to cause it to fill with a rich, 
creamy drink that tastes like chocolate. When you drink 
this beverage, it fills you with a rejuvenating and magical 
vigor that builds over the course of 1 minute. At the end 
of this minute, you can choose to recover one expended 
spell slot by spending a number of Hit Dice equal to the 
spell slot’s level, up to a maximum of 5. Once the mug 
has created this beverage, it can’t create it again until 
the next dawn.
"
Medusan Lavalier,"Wondrous item, rare
This pair of metallic snakes forms a twisting necklace 
that hangs around your neck. It coils and moves almost 
imperceptibly, keeping latched together at the nape of 
your neck where the snakes’ tails intertwine. You can 
wear or remove the necklace using an action. While 
wearing this necklace, you can’t become petrified or 
otherwise turned to stone against your will. If you are 
already petrified or turning to stone when you wear 
the necklace, the effect is suppressed until you remove 
it, provided that its duration has not expired in the 
meantime.
"
Medusan Signet,"Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)
When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed 
outright while wearing this ring, you don’t fall prone 
but are immediately turned to stone and are petrified. 
You remain petrified until you die or are targeted by the 
greater restoration spell, or until you regain any number 
of hit points, regaining consciousness and returning to 
your normal form when you do. While petrified in this 
way, you don’t make death saving throws at the start of 
each of your turns, although you still suffer failures if 
you take damage. In addition, critical hits against you 
while petrified become normal hits, as your stone form 
offers some protection. When you regain consciousness, 
you also gain 2d6 + 3 temporary hit points that last for 
1 minute as the stone form’s lingering protection slowly 
fades. Once this property has been used 3 times, the 
ring turns to dust and is destroyed.
"
Medzo’s Crossbow,"Weapon (crossbow, hand), rare
This crossbow once belonged to a savage gambler. 
Scoring a critical hit with this magic weapon doesn’t 
double the weapon’s damage dice, and when you roll a 
1 on an attack roll made with it, the weapon jams and 
can’t be used again until the end of your next turn.
A target hit with a ranged attack from this crossbow 
takes 3d4 piercing damage, instead of its normal 
damage. When you hit with an attack using this weapon 
and roll three of the same number on its damage dice, 
use the matching number to determine what effect 
occurs using the table below. When this happens, the 
target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage.
Matching 
Number
Effect
1
You can reroll one of the weapon’s damage 
dice, even if it was a matching number. You 
must use the new roll.
2
The next attack roll made against the 
target before the end of your next turn has 
advantage.
3
The target has disadvantage on attack rolls 
it makes until the end of your next turn.
4
If the target is a hostile creature, 30gp 
magically appears at your feet.
"
Meta Mantle,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a 
sorcerer)
This short scarlet robe’s interior and sleeves hold 
hundreds of arcane runes that have been embroidered 
with platinum thread. While wearing the robes, you can 
change your known Metamagic options whenever you 
finish a long rest. In addition, you gain the following 
three Metamagic options to choose from.
Delayed Spell.
 When you take the Ready action to 
ready a spell that targets a point within its range, you 
can spend 3 sorcery points to choose a point you can 
see within that spell’s range. Readying this spell doesn’t 
require concentration, can be released as a reaction 
within 1 minute, and when the spell is released, it 
targets the chosen point (even if you can no longer see 
it) and is cast as though you were in the same space as 
when you took the Ready action. A spell readied in this 
way fades and has no effect if it’s not released within 1 
minute. You can only have one spell readied at a time in 
this way.
Emergency Spell.
 When a creature hits you with an 
attack or you take damage, you can use your reaction 
and spend 6 sorcery points to cast a spell that has a 
casting time of 1 action or bonus action.
Expanded Spell.
 When you cast a spell that affects 
an area such as a line, cone, or sphere, you can spend 
2 sorcery points to increase its area of affect. A line’s 
length increases by 15 feet, a cone’s size increases 
by 5 feet, a cube’s size increases by 5 feet on a side, 
a sphere’s radius increases by 5 feet, and a cylinder’s 
diameter or height increases by 5 feet or 10 feet, 
respectively (your choice).
"
Meta Medallion,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)
This small medallion is 1 inch tall and made of a strange 
metal that contains a mote of pure magic. While wearing 
the medallion, your understanding of Metamagic 
expands, granting you one additional Metamagic option 
of your choice. As long as you continue to wear the 
medallion, you can change this option when you finish a 
long rest.
"
Mimicloak,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This strange cloak is made using the enchanted remains 
of a young mimic. While wearing it, you can use a bonus 
action to speak its command word to change the style, 
color, and apparent quality of the cloak. The garment’s 
weight doesn’t change. Regardless of its appearance, the 
cloak can’t be anything but a cloak with these properties.
While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on 
ability checks made to escape from a grapple. Whenever 
you make an ability check to escape a grapple or free 
yourself from restraints, the creature or object holding 
you takes 1d10 piercing damage as the cloak’s fabric 
magically splits into a toothed maw to bite it.
"
Mindmaster’s Monocle,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)
This ancient golden monocle’s lens is a roughly hewn 
ruby. While you wear this monocle, it magically floats 
in front of your eye, instead of resting on your face, 
and you can see clearly through its ruby lens. While 
peering through the lens, you always know if a creature 
you can see is concentrating on a spell. You perceive a 
concentrating creature’s head as being shrouded in an 
indigo mist.
This monocle has 10 charges for the following 
properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at 
dawn.
Spells.
 While wearing the monocle, you can use 
an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of 
the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: 
arcane eye
 (4 charges), 
detect thoughts
 (2 charges), or 
telepathic bond
 (5 charges).
Mental Assault.
 While wearing the monocle, you can 
use a bonus action to expend 3 of its charges to attempt 
to break a creature’s concentration on a spell. The target 
must be within 60 feet of you, and you must be able to 
see it. When you do, make an Intelligence check contest-
ed by the target’s spellcasting ability check. If you win 
the contest, the target’s concentration on the spell ends.
"
Mistwalker Armor,"Armor (leather), rare (requires attunement)
This dark leather armor releases thin wisps of fog from 
its seams. While wearing this armor, you can use an 
action to cast the fog cloud spell (2nd-level version) from 
it. Once this property of the armor has been used, it 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
In addition, fog doesn’t obscure your vision, and while 
you’re in opaque fog, you can use your movement to 
teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see in the 
fog. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to the 
distance you teleport.
"
Monarch Mantle,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
While wearing this silky, scalloped cloak, you can use 
a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until 
the end of your turn. The cloak flaps behind you like 
butterfly wings while flying in this way.
In addition, the cloak has 3 charges and regains 1d3 
expended charges daily at dawn. When a creature that 
you can see hits you with an attack while you’re wearing 
this cloak, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its 
charges to take half as much damage from the attack 
and teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space that 
you can see. When you do, you reappear in a flourish 
of butterflies that remain in that space until the end of 
the current turn, imposing disadvantage on any attack 
roll against you while you remain in that space for the 
duration.
"
Monster Tamer’s Shield,"Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)
This shield punishes certain creatures for their hostility 
and comes from a culture whose dominion is in direct 
competition with powerful beasts. While holding this 
shield, whenever you take damage from a melee attack 
made by a beast or monstrosity, that creature takes 1d4 
psychic damage. In addition, you have advantage on 
Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks.
Tamer’s Protection.
 If you are also attuned to the 
monster tamer’s sword
 and are holding this shield, any 
creature captured by the sword gains a +1 bonus to its 
AC and can’t be charmed.
"
Monster Tamer’s Sword,"Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)
This magic weapon exerts dominance over certain 
creatures and was crafted by a culture known for its 
hunting and battling of monsters.
This sword has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 
expended charges daily at dawn. As a reaction when 
you reduce a Large or smaller beast or monstrosity 
of challenge rating 3 or lower to 0 hit points with this 
weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to try and 
capture it instead. The creature must make a DC 15 
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it disappears 
and is contained within the sword with 1 hit point. 
On a success, it resists the effect and falls to 0 hit 
points. Shapechangers automatically succeed on the 
saving throw. Only one creature can be captured by the 
sword at any time.
As an action while holding the sword, you can speak 
its command phrase to release the stored creature. 
It reappears in an unoccupied space that you can see 
within 10 feet of you. The creature is friendly to you 
and your companions. Roll initiative for the creature, 
which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands 
that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you 
don’t issue any commands to it, it defends itself from 
hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The 
GM has the creature’s statistics. The creature returns 
to the sword after 1 minute if you’re within 100 feet of 
it, or earlier if you touch the creature with the sword as 
an action. The creature ceases to be friendly to you and 
your companions if it’s unable to return to the sword, or 
if you release control of it using a bonus action, or if it 
takes damage from you or an ally.
While you’re holding the sword and the creature is 
stored within it or within 30 feet of you, you can use 
a bonus action to speak the weapon’s command word 
and expend 1 or more of its charges to restore 10 hit 
points to that creature for each charge spent. A captured 
creature can only regain hit points in this way.
"
Moonstone Bracers,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
These leather bracers are adorned with moonstones and 
unique wolfen buckles made of silver. While wearing 
these bracers, you have immunity to damage from the 
moonbeam
 spell, and have resistance to nonmagical 
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from sil-
vered weapons.
While wearing the bracers in an area of dim light or 
darkness, you can use your action to cast 
polymorph
 on 
yourself, transforming into a wolf. While you are in the 
form of the wolf, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, 
and Charisma scores. The bracers can’t be used this way 
again until the next dusk.
"
Mosshide Troll Belt,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Magical, flowering vines have been fashioned 
around the remains of a troll’s hide, preserving a 
fragment of its renowned regeneration ability. While 
wearing this belt, your Constitution score increases by 
2, to a maximum of 20.
In addition, the belt’s restorative magic activates when 
it senses danger. While in combat, you regain 1d4 + 1 hit 
points at the start of your turn if you have less than half 
your hit points left. This property ceases to function for 
1 hour if you take acid or fire damage, or until the next 
dawn if you drop to 0 hit points.
"
Mourningsteel Demi-Gauntlets,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This pair of dark, open-fingered gauntlets are made from 
mourningsteel, a metal whose ore has been steeped in 
the blood of countless fallen creatures. While wearing 
the gauntlets, you have resistance to necrotic damage.
The gauntlets have 12 charges and regain 1d6 + 6 
expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the 
gauntlets, you can use an action to cast one of the 
following spells from them using a spell attack bonus 
of +8: 
chill touch
 (no charges, or 1 to cast at 5th level), 
inflict wounds
 (1 charge per spell level, up to 5th), or 
vampiric touch
 (3 charges). Damage dealt by these 
spells ignores resistance to necrotic damage.
In addition, if you spend a charge to cast 
chill 
touch
 from the gauntlets and hit a creature, you can 
immediately choose to expend additional charges to cast 
either the 
inflict wounds
 or 
vampiric touch
 spell from 
them as part of the action to cast the cantrip. When you 
do, the cantrip’s skeletal hand delivers the spell to the 
target, instead of requiring you to touch it. If you were 
already concentrating on the 
vampiric touch
 spell when 
you hit a creature with 
chill touch
 in this way (after 
spending a charge to cast it), you don’t need to expend 
any additional charges to deliver your 
vampiric touch
 
spell to the target. Necrotic damage dealt by 
chill touch
 
doesn’t count toward the amount dealt by 
vampiric 
touch
 for the purpose of calculating the number of hit 
points you regain from the spell.
"
Mourningsteel Ghost Candle,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This candle holder and its candle never run out of wax 
while it burns, even if you aren’t attuned to it. Although 
wax runs down the sides of the candle, it never drips 
off it onto the holder, nor does it ever seem to be 
diminished or consumed. The candle can’t be removed 
from the holder. While the candle burns, ghostly hands 
reach out from the holder as if to warm their hands by 
the tiny fire.
If you’re holding the lit candle and its holder while 
attuned to it, will-o’-wisps are indifferent toward you and 
will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. 
In addition, you can use an action to cast the 
blink
 spell 
from it. For the duration of the spell, whenever you 
vanish from your current plane of existence, a will-o’-
wisp appears in your space there instead. The will-o’-
wisp’s turn is immediately after your own, and it obeys 
your mental commands (no action required by you). The 
will-o’-wisp vanishes when you return from the Ethereal 
Plane or when it’s reduced to 0 hit points, at which 
point you return early to an unoccupied space of your 
choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you 
vanished from.
Once the candle and holder have been used to cast 
this spell, it can’t do so again until the next dusk.
"
Mourningsteel Half Plate,"Armor (half plate), legendary (requires attunement)
This dark armor has been made from mourningsteel, 
a metal refined from ore found beneath the battlefields 
of particularly vicious wars. Steeped in the blood from 
relentless battles, this metal carries with it a magical 
aversion to all things holy. While wearing this armor, you 
gain a +1 bonus to AC and have resistance to radiant 
damage. While you wear it, you gain the following 
benefits:
Death Transference.
 Whenever you are subjected 
to necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to take 
no damage and instead gain a number of temporary 
hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. This 
property of the armor can’t be used again until the next 
dusk.
Spells.
 You can use an action to cast one of the 
following spells (save DC 17) from the armor: 
bestow 
curse
, 
divine word
, or 
nondetection
. Once the armor has 
been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used to cast that 
spell again until the next dusk.
The Battlefield Remembers.
 You can use an action 
to touch a weapon, piece of armor, or similar object 
that’s seen blood and battle to recreate the effect of the 
legend lore
 spell, using the touched object as the subject 
of the effect. Once this property of the armor has been 
used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.
Unholy Aura.
 As a bonus action, you can speak the 
armor’s command word to surround yourself with an 
aura of grim blasphemy. The aura remains for 1 minute 
or until you are incapacitated or die. For the duration, 
celestials have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, 
and the first time that a celestial moves within 5 feet 
of you on its turn or starts its turn there, that creature 
takes 1d10 necrotic damage. This damage ignores 
resistance and immunity. In addition, once before the 
aura ends, if you fail a saving throw against an effect 
from a celestial (such as a solar’s Slaying Longbow), you 
can choose to succeed instead. Once the aura ends, it 
can’t be used again until the next dusk.
"
Mourningsteel War Banner,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This war standard is adorned with a tattered, bloodied 
banner of an army long lost to time. The standard is 
6 feet tall and weighs 7 pounds, but can be collapsed 
down to 3 feet tall or extended up to its full length 
by using a bonus action. While the banner is on your 
person, you have advantage on saving throws against 
being frightened.
The standard has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expend-
ed charges daily at dawn. While holding the extended 
standard, you can use an action to speak its command 
word and plant it on the ground in an unoccupied space 
within your reach. While the standard is within your 
reach, you can use an action to remove it. Alternatively, 
another creature that can reach the standard can use 
an action to make a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check, 
removing it on a success. While the standard remains 
there, the space becomes difficult terrain.
As part of the action to plant the standard, you can 
expend any number of its charges to magically summon 
"
Murk Blowgun,"Weapon (blowgun), uncommon
A hefty blowgun used by the inhabitants of the Murk: 
a series of deadly swamps whose waters are polluted 
with an uncanny poison. When you hit a creature with 
a ranged attack using this magic blowgun, that creature 
takes an extra 1d4 poison damage. When you roll a 
20 on a ranged attack roll made with the blowgun, the 
target must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving 
throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. It is 
incapacitated while poisoned in this way.
In addition, this blowgun can be wielded as a magic 
club.
"
Myceliaweave Armor,"Armor (leather, studded leather, or hide), rare (requires 
attunement)
This naturally-sourced armor is interwoven with fibers 
and caps from a resilient strain of violet fungus that 
grows when exposed to rejuvenating magic. While 
wearing this armor, your Constitution score increases 
by 2, to a maximum of 20, and whenever a spell or 
magical effect causes you to regain hit points, you also 
gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the 
number of hit points you recover, up to a maximum of 
15 temporary hit points. While you have temporary hit 
points in this way, you also have resistance to necrotic 
damage.
Curse.
 Once you don and attune to this magic armor, 
you can’t doff it unless you die or are targeted by the 
remove curse
 spell: a side effect of the violet fungus’ 
magical and parasitic effects. When your attunement 
to the armor ends, your Constitution score is reduced 
by 2 (to a minimum score of 1) until 2d6 + 6 days have 
passed or until you attune to the armor again.
"
Night Owl’s Half-Moon Spectacles,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While attuned to these darkened, horned spectacles, you 
gain the following benefits:
 
y
 You can use an action while wearing the glasses to 
cast the 
comprehend languages
 spell from them. 
The spell ends early if you remove them.
 
y
 At the start of a long rest, you can place the glasses 
next to a book or stack of parchment, such as on a 
desk, to create a spectral copy of yourself. The copy 
appears after 10 minutes, sheds dim light in a 5-foot 
radius, and remains for the duration of the rest or 
until the glasses are moved or you move more than 
30 feet away from them. It can perform light activity 
within the glasses’ space, such as reading, writing, 
or copying spells into your spellbook, provided it 
has all the materials necessary to do so. You decide 
what the copy does at the start of the long rest. The 
copy can’t speak, hear, or see anything outside of its 
space. When you finish the long rest, you learn any 
information the copy read or wrote about over the 
course of the rest.
"
Nightmare Flask,"Wondrous item, rare
This glass orb has a special funnel at its top that traps 
bad dreams. When you finish a long rest in which you 
sleep while the orb is on your person, there is a 25 
percent chance that the orb is filled with a small amount 
of dark, swirling smoke: a visual representation of a 
collected nightmare. The orb can collect 1 nightmare 
every 24 hours and can hold up to 10 nightmares in this 
way.
"
Nightstalker’s Armor of the Northeastern Wind,"Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)
This unusual armor is composed of blue metal plates 
with a horned helm, and was tempered by the frigid 
breath of an oni.
Retributive Cold.
 When you take damage from a 
creature that is within 5 feet of you while wearing 
this armor, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 cold 
damage to that creature.
Freezing Fog.
 While wearing this armor, you can use 
a bonus action to speak its command word to cast the 
gaseous form
 spell from it, targeting only yourself, with 
the following changes:
 
y
  You take the form of a frigid cloud of fog, creating 
illusory frost on objects you touch.
 
y
  You can take the Attack action while in this form. 
When you do, your attacks are unarmed strikes 
that deal 1d6 cold damage, instead of their normal 
damage.
 
y
  You can use the armor’s Retributive Cold property.
 
y
  The spell has a duration of 1 minute.
Once this property has been used, it can’t be used 
again until the next dusk.
"
Nightstalker’s Mask,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This demon-faced mask has 3 charges and regains 1d3 
expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the 
mask, you can expend 1 of its charges when you take 
the Hide action to become invisible until the end of your 
next turn. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with 
you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell. If 
you make an attack against a creature while invisible in 
this way and hit, the target takes an extra 1d10 psychic 
damage.
"
No-Stones,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This engraved geode has been split apart into two 
equal halves. A labyrinth is carved into the rock’s rough 
exterior and glows with a faint light.
While holding one of the halves, you can use an action 
to speak the geode’s command word, “unturned,” and 
turn it over so the flat, gem-encrusted side is pressed 
against a solid stone, natural metal (such as iron or 
silver), or earthen surface such as a floor or wall. When 
you do, the geode becomes magically fixed in place 
against the surface and projects a 3-foot-spherical map 
above it, showing the area within 120 feet of it. The 
map shows all walls, floors, and other surfaces made 
of either stone, natural metal, or earth within range as 
translucent outlines and shapes. The map is entirely 
monochromatic, but shows the general location of any 
trap or gemstone within its range with a shapeless, red 
glow.
The geode remains fixed in place until you speak its 
command word again using a bonus action, its surface 
moves, or it’s forced to hold more than 100 pounds. A 
creature can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength 
check, moving the geode and causing the map to vanish.
Once a half has been used in this way, that half can’t 
be used again until the next dawn.

Novanite Armor,"Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), very rare (requires 
attunement)
Novanite is a strong metal smelt from ore mined in the 
Astral Plane. Armor made from this metal absorbs more 
light than normal and gives off a strange, otherworldly 
aura. Glimmering cosmos can be seen in the armor’s 
reflections at night. You have a +1 bonus to AC while 
wearing this armor.
Astral Leap.
 While wearing this armor, you can speak 
its command word as an action to choose a space you 
can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, you vanish 
into a planar tear and reappear at the chosen spot 
at the start of your next turn, remaining in the Astral 
Plane until you do. If you would arrive in a place already 
occupied by an object or a creature, you take 3d6 force 
damage and appear in the nearest unoccupied space. 
This property of the armor can’t be used again until 12 
hours have passed.
Disappearing and reappearing in this way creates 
vacuums and waves as space is pushed and pulled 
around you. Other creatures within 10 feet of you when 
you vanish or reappear must make a DC 15 Strength 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 
force damage and is pulled up to 10 feet toward the 
space you left from, or pushed 10 feet away from the 
space you reappear in. On a successful save, a creature 
takes half as much force damage and is not pulled or 
pushed.
"
Oaken Candle,"Wondrous item, common
This magic, bark-like candle emits a green flame when 
burned, which sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and 
dim light for an additional 5 feet. You can light the 
candle as an action. After burning for 1d8 + 4 hours, 
the candle is destroyed and an oak tree no more than 
30 feet tall grows in its place over the course of 10 
minutes. If there isn’t enough room for a tree to grow 
or the candle isn’t placed on solid ground, the candle is 
destroyed without creating a tree.
"
Oathkeeper’s Resolve,"Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement by a paladin)
This star-shaped mithral buckler weighs 2 pounds and 
bolsters your sense of holy purpose. While holding this 
shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in 
addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.
The center of the shield is ornamented with a durable, 
glassy lens that can project your holy radiance. You can 
use a bonus action while holding this shield to cause it 
to emit bright light from the lens in a 15-foot radius and 
dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light lasts until 
you use a bonus action to extinguish it or until you drop 
to 0 hit points.
Radiant Aura.
 When you doff this shield or by using 
an action, you can speak the shield’s command word and 
choose to throw it to a friendly creature (if it has a free 
hand) or unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that 
"
Octavius’s Saber,"Weapon (rapier), legendary (requires attunement by a rogue)
The swirling guard of this powerful blade is a mesh of 
floral and serpentine sculpture. You gain a +3 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 
When you deal Sneak Attack damage with an attack 
using this weapon, you treat any 1 on a Sneak Attack 
damage die as an 8.
"
Ogramau’s Graveyard,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or 
wizard)
This glass orb has a miniature graveyard inside and 
has a base made from a hollowed humanoid skull. It’s 
roughly fist-sized and weighs 1 pound. While the orb is 
on your person, undead creatures have disadvantage 
on attack rolls against you. If you’re holding the orb, 
you can use an action to speak one of its two command 
words.
The first command word shunts a Medium or Small 
humanoid corpse that you can see within 5 feet of you 
into a special demiplane contained within the orb. A 
corpse within this demiplane doesn’t age, effectively 
extending the time limit on raising it from the dead. If 
you shunt a second corpse into the demiplane while 
another one is there, the first corpse reappears in the 
space left behind by the new one.
The second command word duplicates the effect of 
the 
animate dead
 spell, using a corpse stored within the 
orb’s demiplane as the target of the spell. A skeleton or 
zombie created in this way appears in an unoccupied 
space that you can see within 15 feet of you and turns to 
dust and is destroyed after either 24 hours have passed 
or it drops to 0 hit points. If you speak this command 
word again to create a second skeleton or zombie while 
the first one remains, the first skeleton or zombie turns 
to dust and is destroyed when the new one appears.
"
Ol’ Stumpy,"Weapon (maul), uncommon
This lashed-together stump and stick carry an age-old 
enchantment from an unknown source. Over time, the 
strength of the magic has faded, but this heirloom of 
a weapon has remained in caring hands all the while. 
Creatures hit with this magic weapon take an extra 1d4 
poison damage. If the creature is fey, you deal maximum 
poison damage instead of rolling.
“But it’s not fair! The answer means 
nothing! The riddle can’t be solved if—”
The bog fey’s tantrum was cut short by 
a hollow thud. Kneeling by its unconscious 
form, Angus the Grizzled muttered through 
his matted beard, “S’not meant to. S’meant 
t’leave ya stumped.”
"
Orb of Remembrance,"Wondrous item, common
This glassy orb is 3 inches in diameter, weighs 1/2 
pound, and is wrapped in a golden wire cage. Strange, 
wispy smoke drifts around inside the orb, creating 
cloud-like shapes that are almost recognizable as real-
life objects.
While holding the orb, you can use an action to speak 
its command word, priming the orb and causing the 
smoke inside to restlessly billow and swirl. You can 
gently squeeze the primed orb (no action required) to 
cause it to record that moment in time around you. 
When you do, the glassy sphere becomes perfectly 
clear over the course of 1 minute and reveals an exact 
duplicate of the area around you in up to a 30-foot 
radius as a miniature, illusory diorama inside it. While 
holding the orb, the scene inside soundlessly replays the 
next 6 seconds following the diorama’s capture.
An orb remains primed for 1 minute or until used 
to capture a diorama. Touching a primed 
orb of 
remembrance
 to one that already has a diorama creates 
a duplicate of the diorama in the primed orb. Speaking 
the command word again while shaking the orb causes 
the diorama inside to disappear into smoke, allowing it 
to be primed once more.
"
Orelia’s Tome of Beast Familiars,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)
While attuned to this book, you always have the 
find 
familiar
 spell prepared. This spell doesn’t count against 
the number of spells you have prepared.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level 
or higher, your familiar can take on the form of stronger 
animals. The spell slot level determines what beasts 
your familiar can take the form of, as shown in the table 
below.
Spell Slot Level
Max CR

1/4
5–6
1/2

In addition, when you cast this spell using a spell slot 
of 2nd level or higher, it requires an extra 10 gp worth 
of material components for each slot level above 1st. If 
your attunement to the book ends, any familiar you have 
disappears, leaving behind no physical form.
"
Orner’s Venomous Crossbow,"Weapon (crossbow, hand), uncommon (requires attunement)
This magic crossbow carries a small system of curious 
tubes and vessels. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The 
crossbow has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended 
charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 of the weapon’s 
charges when you make an attack with it to coat the 
fired bolt with a unique, self-generating venom. If the 
attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage 
and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On 
a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of its 
next turn.
If you expend the crossbow’s last charge, roll a d20. 
On a 1, the vessels attached to the crossbow shatter and 
spray poison in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on your 
location. Creatures within the sphere take 1d12 poison 
damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. When this 
happens, the crossbow ceases to be magical and loses 
all of its additional properties.
"
Orostead Iced Tea,"Potion, rarity varies
The typical 
Orostead iced tea
, a common potion, is 
a specialty alcoholic beverage that creates harmless 
sensory effects with each sip. When made, a tea has 
enough for 6 + 1d4 sips before it’s used up, instead of 
a single use. You can take a sip as an action. When you 
drink this potion, roll on the table below to determine 
which one of the following effects occur:
d8
Common Effect
1
You suddenly become drenched with illusory salt 
water. After 1 minute, it dries.
2
You’re suddenly overwhelmingly warm (50%) or 
cold (50%) for 1 minute.
3
You remain frozen in place for 1 second, as if 
briefly removed from time.
4
You gain the effect of the 
speak with animals
 
spell 
for 1 minute.
5
You suddenly teleport 5 feet into an unoccupied 
space next to you.
6
Any clothing you wear becomes various shades of 
gray for 1 minute.
7
Static charge builds up on you. Touching or being

sharp shock of electricity to leap between you.
8
Your skin, hair, and eye colors are inverted. In 
addition, roll a d12. You grow or shrink a number 
of inches equal to the result of the die, shrinking 
by odd numbers or growing by even ones. After 1 
minute, your appearance returns to normal.
The drink is incredibly refreshing with notes of lemon, 
tea, and cherry, and has virtually no alcoholic bite to it. 
Regardless, due to its magical nature, the alcohol within 
this potion affects a creature twice as much as the 
alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
The following 
Orostead iced tea
 is a very rare variant 
with additional properties. It also tastes better.
When you take a sip of this potion, roll a d8 and 
consult the table below instead to determine which one

fireball
 spell once with-
in the next 8 hours, casting the spell at 6th level 
and using a spell save DC of 16 when you do.
A now-famous remnant of the very brief School of Mixology course 
taught at the Spire in Orostead. This single drink caused more 
mayhem in one week than the city had seen since the Upheaval. The 
class was immediately canceled, but its legend continues to live on in 
this miraculous drink.
It also, begrudgingly admitted by the Spire administration, led 
to a sharp increase in Adventuring Guild requests for wizarding 
parties—in both senses of the word.
"
Overseer’s Spade,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This golden shovel is miraculously resistant to impacts 
and scrapes. As an action, you can touch the tip of the 
shovel to a patch of loose earth within 5 feet of you 
and speak its command word. When you do, you can 
magically excavate up to a total of eight contiguous 
5-foot cubes of loose, nonmagical earth, starting from 
where you touched the shovel. It takes 1 minute for 
these changes to take effect. Any dirt or stone removed 
in this way is destroyed, leaving behind any loose metals 
or gemstones within the excavated area. The shovel can 
only remove up to eight 5-foot cubes of earth in this way 
each day.
"
Owlbear Leather Armor,"Armor (leather), uncommon (requires attunement)
This set of leather armor was made from the remains 
of a hardy and ferocious owlbear. While wearing this 
armor, if you fail a Constitution saving throw against an 
effect from a hostile source, you can choose to succeed 
instead. Once this property of the armor has been used, 
it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Pack of Revisibility Bombs,"Wondrous item, rare
A 
pack of revisibility bombs
 typically includes 1d3 + 
3 fist-sized bombs when found. You can use an action 
to throw a bomb at a point that you can see within 60 
feet of you. The bomb explodes at the point where it 
impacts, destroying the bomb and releasing a dispelling 
vapor in a cloud around it. When the bomb explodes, 
each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature 
becomes visible if it isn’t already, and can’t become 
invisible for 1 minute. Objects within the area that aren’t 
being worn or carried automatically become visible if 
they’re invisible and can’t become invisible for 1 minute.
"
Pegasus Quill,"Wondrous item, uncommon
The feather adorning this quill was a gift from a mighty 
pegasus and has a beautiful, pearlescent shimmer. 
When you write with this magic quill, the time it takes 
for you to write something, such as copying a spell into a 
spellbook or creating a spell scroll, is halved.
"
Pennypuncher Slingshot,"Weapon (sling), rare
This slingshot requires two hands to attack and is 
adorned with coin-like designs. You gain a +1 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 
In addition, when you make a ranged attack with this 
weapon and use a coin as its ammunition, it deals extra 
damage on a hit based on the value of the coin you use:
Coin
Damage Bonus
1cp
+1
1sp
+1d4
1ep
+1d6
1gp
+1d8
1pp
+1d12
Recovering coins fired in this way follows the normal 
rules for recovering ammunition. Depending on the 
nature of the battlefield, you may recover more or fewer 
coins than normal as determined by the GM.
"
Peregrine Spear,"Weapon (spear), rare
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic spear. When you make a ranged attack 
with this spear, you can speak its command word to 
cause the weapon to soar through the air straight 
toward the target and magically build momentum. Hit 
"
Performer’s Puppet,"Wondrous item, common
This simple puppet is a favorite among street 
performers and traveling thespians. While wearing 
the puppet on your hand, you can use a bonus action 
to change the style, color, and shape of the puppet’s 
clothing and face. The material is always made of 
a colored canvas, but its eyes, stitching, and other 
descriptive details can change when using this property. 
In addition, while wearing the puppet on your hand and 
holding it aloft, your voice originates from the puppet 
instead of you.
"
Periscope Rod,"Rod, common
This silver rod is 1 foot long and is polished to a mirror 
finish. Its two ends are bent in different directions 
and are emblazoned with the symbol of an eye. While 
holding the rod, you can speak its command word 
as either an action or as part of making a Wisdom 
(Perception) check, placing your eye against one of the 
rod’s ends. When you do, you can magically see through 
the rod and outside the far end as if the rod were a 
spyglass. While looking through the rod in this way, you 
can use a bonus action to mentally control the angle of 
the rod’s ends, as well as its length. The rod can grow 
up to 5 feet long in this way, and returns to its normal 
size when your remove your eye from it.
"
Phantom Walkers,"Wondrous item, uncommon
While wearing these boots, the DC of any ability checks 
made to track your movements using your footprints 
increases by 5.
In addition, you can use a bonus action to cause the 
boots to leave behind no footprints for 1 minute. When 
you do, another set of similar footprints appear on the 
ground that lead in random directions. These footprints 
last for 8 hours and travel up to 300 feet. A successful 
DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the foot-
prints are magical. Once this property of the boots has 
been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Phasing Bow,"Weapon (any bow), very rare (requires attunement)
This flexible bow is made from the chitinous legs of a 
phase spider and retains some of its ethereal properties. 
When you hit with a ranged attack using this magic bow, 
the target takes an extra 1d4 force damage.
The bow has 5 charges and regains all expended 
charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack 
with this bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause 
the arrow to slip partially into the Ethereal Plane. When 
you do, the target of the attack gains no benefit from cov-
er, including total cover, as long as the cover isn’t made 
of lead or more than 1 foot thick. If you hit, the target 
takes an extra 3d4 force damage. Any effect that blocks 
travel through the Ethereal Plane also blocks the arrow.
Alternatively, you can speak the bow’s command word 
as a bonus action to expend 3 of its charges and fire an 
arrow at a point you can see within the weapon’s normal 
range. When the arrow hits a solid surface, you vanish 
from your location and reappear in an unoccupied space 
nearest to that point.
"
Phoenix Breastplate,"Armor (breastplate), very rare (requires attunement)
This golden breastplate has the shape of a phoenix 
worked into its design. While wearing this armor, you 
gain a +1 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.
When you’re reduced to 0 hit points but not killed 
outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. 
When you do, a fiery explosion surrounds you. Hostile 
creatures within 30 feet of you must make a DC 16 
Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 fire damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
You and other friendly creatures within the area regain a 
number of hit points equal to the same amount, instead 
of taking fire damage. Once this property of the armor 
has been used, it can’t be used again until 1d6 + 1 days 
have passed.
"
Phoenix Rocket Sword,"Weapon (greatsword), very rare (requires attunement)
This heavy, steel greatsword creates a powerful fan of 
flames from curious, whirring chambers mounted to 
the blade. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage 
rolls made with this magic weapon. The sword has 10 
charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at 
dawn.
As an action, you can hold the sword out in front of 
you and speak its command word to expend up to 5 of 
its charges, causing a jet of flame to erupt from it. When 
you do, the sword emits a roar that’s audible out to 100 
feet, and you must succeed on a Strength saving throw 
or be pushed back 20 feet for each charge you expend. 
You can choose to fail this saving throw, whose DC 
equals 10 + the number of charges you expend. This 
movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. Pointing 
the blade down and expending charges in this way 
launches you upward instead. If you do and you are not 
launched, the sword’s flames spread out in a 15-foot-
radius circle, centered on you.
The jet of flame spreads out in a 15-foot cone and 
moves with you if you’re pushed. Any creature in the 
area when the flame first appears or when it moves 
into the creature’s space must make a DC 16 Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 fire 
damage, or half as much fire damage on a success. The 
fire damage increases by 1d6 for each additional charge 
you expend beyond the first.
If you strike an object because of this forced 
movement, such as a wall or floor, you take 1d6 
bludgeoning damage for every charge you expend and 
are knocked prone. If you strike a creature, you and that 
creature take the same bludgeoning damage and must 
each succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 10 + the 
number of charges you expend) or be knocked prone.
"
Pick and Pocket,"Weapon (dagger), rare
This brass and steel dagger can also be used as part of 
a set of thieves’ tools when picking locks. You gain a +1 
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic 
weapon, as well as on any ability check you make using 
thieves’ tools to pick open a lock, provided you use the 
dagger as part of the set of tools.
"
Pisces Shield,"Armor (shield), uncommon
This round iron shield is emblazoned with two spiraling 
golden koi. If the shield is submerged in water for at 
least 1 minute, the koi begin to animate and swim 
across the surface of the shield for up to 24 hours. 
While the koi are swimming in this way, the next time 
you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or 
saving throw while holding the shield, you can treat the 
roll as if it were a 20 instead. When you do, the koi stop 
swimming, and they can’t swim again until 24 hours 
have passed.
"
Poison Armor of Amphibios,"Armor (light), rare (requires attunement)
This armor is enriched by poisonous frog toxins. While 
wearing this armor, you have advantage on saving 
throws against poison, and you have resistance to 
poison damage. In addition, the armor has 3 charges 
and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When 
a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee 
attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the 
armor’s charges to release a spray of poison from the 
armor at the attacker. The attacker must make a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target 
takes 2d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the end 
of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes 
half as much poison damage and isn’t poisoned.
"
Pollinator Carapace,"Armor (leather, studded leather, or hide), uncommon 
(requires attunement by a druid or ranger)
This black and yellow armor has a billowing plume of 
soft fur around its neck and chest. Draped over its shoul-
ders is a scalloped cape that’s split into two translucent, 
wing-like ends.
The armor has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can 
expend 1 of its charges (no action required) to activate 
the cape, transforming it into a pair of insect-like wings 
for 1 hour. For the duration of the wings, you gain a 
flying speed of 30 feet and can hover.
Beekeeper’s Commitment.
 While you are attuned 
to three magic items that have this named property, 
the armor regains all expended charges daily at dawn, 
instead of 1d3, and gains the following benefit:
Pollinator.
 While the armor’s cape is transformed, it 
releases a sparkling mist of enchanting pollen. For the 
duration, any insect or plant creature that targets you 
with an attack or harmful spell must first make a DC 
15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature 
must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell.
"
Pollinator Pants,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid 
or ranger)
While wearing this pair of black-and-yellow striped 
pants, any flower you move within 5 feet of magically 
blossoms, as if by the 
druidcraft
 spell.
The pants have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. While wearing the pants, you 
can use an action to expend 1 of their charges to cast 
the 
speak with plants
 spell from them. This version of 
the spell only affects plants within the spell’s range that 
have at least one flower on them. When you speak with a 
plant in this way, you do so by making a combination of 
somatic gestures and dance-like steps, rather than using 
your voice. These movements come naturally to you 
for the duration of the spell and magically convey your 
message.
Beekeeper’s Commitment.
 While you are attuned 
to three magic items that have this named property, the 
pants regain all expended charges daily at dawn, instead 
of 1d3, and gain the following benefit:
Sting.
 When you take the Attack action on each 
of your turns, you can use a bonus action to make a 
special unarmed strike against a creature within 5 feet 
of you. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d4 piercing 
damage from the attack. When you roll a 20 on an attack 
roll made with this unarmed strike, the target takes 
an extra 10 poison damage from the attack and must 
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be 
poisoned until the end of your next turn.
"
Pollinator Visor,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid 
or ranger)
This chitinous mask rests over your ears and can be 
raised or lowered using an action to sit on top of your 
head or in front of your eyes. The mask has two large, 
eye-like lenses that improve your vision and allow you to 
"
Poltergeist Candle Holder,"Wondrous item, common
This pewter candle holder makes your hand feel 
slightly numb while holding it. While holding it, you 
can use a bonus action to speak its command word to 
cause the candle holder to magically hover just above 
your shoulder. The holder floats back to the ground if 
anything other than a candle is placed on it. In addition, 
any candle in the holder releases a thin wisp of smoke 
while lit. The smoke hangs motionless in the air, 
regardless of wind, and dissipates after 6 seconds.
"
Power Collar,"Wondrous item, rare
This spiked leather collar is adjustable in size and has 
a buckle on its side in the shape of a bear’s head. You 
can place the collar on a willing Medium or smaller 
creature using an action. If the creature is a friendly 
beast companion or a familiar (such as one summoned 
by the 
find familiar
 spell), you can speak the collar’s 
command word as part of this action to create a magical 
bond between you and the creature. The bond remains 
until the collar is removed. While the bonded creature is 
wearing the collar, its hit point maximum increases by 
an amount equal to your character level.
In addition, you can use a bonus action to speak 
the collar’s command word while you can see the 
bonded creature within 30 feet of you. When you do, 
the creature gains the effect of the Enlarge option from 
the 
enlarge/reduce
 spell (no concentration required). 
Alternatively, if you drop to 0 hit points while the bonded 
creature is within 30 feet of you, it can use its reaction 
to gain the spell’s effect instead. Once this property of 
the collar has been used, it can’t be used again until 2 
days have passed.
If the beast or familiar wearing the collar is a 
transformed humanoid or other creature, such as by the 
polymorph
 spell or similar magic, the bond fails when 
you speak the command word and the collar has no 
effect. If the bonded creature is a familiar summoned 
by the 
find familiar
 spell, the collar and familiar 
disappear into a pocket dimension together whenever 
you temporarily dismiss it. If the bonded familiar is 
dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves the 
collar behind. A creature can only gain the benefits of 
one magical collar at a time.
"
Prism Glasses,"Wondrous item, common
This pair of magical glasses fits snugly against your face 
without needing to rest over your ears. The lenses are 
made using miniscule prisms that amplify color in dim 
conditions. If you have darkvision while wearing these 
glasses, you perceive color for the first 15 feet you see in 
darkness, instead of shades of gray. In addition, a color-
blind creature wearing these glasses can perceive color 
normally.
"
Prototype Thunderberd,"Weapon (halberd), rare (requires attunement)
This halberd is a long-lost prototype from a now-
dissolved military research facility. Electricity magically 
courses through the weapon along specially channeled 
grooves in its hollow haft. When you hit with an attack 
using this halberd, the target takes an extra 1d6 
lightning damage.
This halberd has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 
expended charges daily at dawn. While the weapon 
has at least 1 charge, you can use an action to load a 
crossbow bolt into its haft toward the bottom of the 
weapon. Powerful magnetic forces inside the hollow 
weapon stabilize the bolt and charge it with electricity. 
When you take the Attack action while holding this 
loaded weapon, you can expend 1 or more of its charges 
to make a special ranged attack with it by leveling and 
firing the halberd as if it were a crossbow. When you 
do, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack, and the 
bolt is magically launched forward from the weapon in 
a 1-foot-wide line that’s 10 feet long, plus an extra 10 
feet for each charge you expend. Each creature in the 
line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or 
take 1d6 piercing damage, plus 1d6 lightning damage 
for each charge you expend. On a successful save, a 
creature takes half as much piercing and lightning 
damage. After the attack, the bolt is destroyed.
If you expend the halberd’s last charge, roll a d20. 
On a 1, the weapon becomes overcharged and splinters 
into an explosion of shrapnel, destroying the halberd. 
Each creature within 10 feet of the weapon must make 
a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature takes 10d6 piercing damage, or half as much 
damage on a successful one.
"
Prying Mace,"Weapon (mace), uncommon
This mace was used by ruthless inquisitors during the 
Upheaval, a century-long war against magical secrets. 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. In addition, when you roll a 
20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a 
living creature with an Intelligence of 6 or higher that 
speaks at least one language, you immediately learn 
what the last lie was that it told. You don’t learn the truth 
behind the lie, only the phrase or phrases that were 
used when telling it. If the phrase is in a language you 
don’t understand, you still learn the phrase, but not its 
meaning.
"
Quick Change Ring,"Ring, rare
This ring grows and shrinks to fit its wearer, but always 
seems slightly large for the finger it’s on. The ring has an 
extradimensional space inside it dedicated to carrying 
armor. You can magically bind one set of unworn light, 
medium, or heavy armor to this extradimensional space 
over the course of 1 hour by resting the ring on top 
of the armor. Only one suit of armor can be bound to 
the ring’s extradimensional space. Binding a second 
suit breaks the bond with the first one, causing it to be 
forced from the extradimensional space and appear in 
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the ring. While 
wearing the ring, you’re considered to be within 100 feet 
of any armor stored inside its extradimensional space.
While wearing this ring, you can use an action to 
speak its command word and touch a suit of bound 
armor, even if you’re wearing it, to shunt it into the ring’s 
extradimensional space. Speaking the command word 
again while the armor is in this extradimensional space 
causes you to magically don the armor, adjusting to fit 
you as needed, or causes it to appear at your feet (your 
choice). If you’re already wearing a suit of armor when 
you don one in this way, the bound armor appears at 
your feet instead. If the armor would magically prevent 
you from doffing it, this property of the ring has no 
effect.
You can create an instantaneous, harmless sensory 
effect when you don or doff a suit of armor with the ring 
in this way, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, 
faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
When found, the ring has a 50 percent chance to have 
a set of bound armor in its extradimensional space. The 
GM can choose a suit of bound armor from the following 
table or roll a d12 to determine it randomly.

Quiver of Elemental Chaos,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This quiver has a lid with 5 holes in it and has 
depictions of the Elemental Planes on its side. It has 4 
buttons along its top that correspond to each of the four 
elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.
Elemental Ammunition.
 The quiver can have up to 
5 arrows or bolts on display at a time, which appear 
through the holes in its lid. You can press one of the 
quiver’s buttons using a bonus action to cause it to 
create and display 1 elemental arrow or bolt. The type 
of arrow or bolt depends on the button you press. The 
quiver can produce up to 5 of each type of ammunition 
in this way each day.
Any arrow or bolt created by this quiver is magical 
and has the following properties based on its element. 
The ammunition is only magical for you, and any arrow 
"
Radiant War Pick,"Weapon (war pick), very rare (requires attunement by a 
cleric or paladin)
This silver and golden weapon is wrapped in fragments 
of holy vestments and glimmers spectacularly in sun and 
moonlight. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage 
rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with 
an attack using this war pick, the target takes an extra 
1d8 radiant damage. If the target is a shapechanger or 
undead, this radiant damage is maximized.
In addition, while holding the war pick, you can use an 
action to expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast 
the 
moonbeam
 (6th-level version) or 
sunbeam
 spell from 
it (save DC 16). Once this property of the weapon has 
been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
You can use an action to speak the war pick’s 
command word to cause it to shed bright light in a 
20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. 
Speaking the command word again puts out the light.
"
Realmswarden Greataxe,"Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement)
This ancient stone axe hilt is intricately carved. At its 
center is a gap that houses a single, perfect diamond 
that’s magically suspended in place and glows with an 
uncanny energy. While grasping the hilt, you can use a 
bonus action to cause a wide blade of pure prismatic 
light to radiate from the axe’s head, or make the blade 
disappear. The axe’s blade emits bright light in a 15-foot 
radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon, which deals force damage 
instead of slashing damage. When you hit an aberration 
or undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d12 
radiant damage.
While the blade persists, you can use a bonus action 
to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 
5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum 
of 10 feet each.
The light that comes from the diamond at the axe’s 
center and forms the blade can be wrought to create 
powerful, destructive glyphs. Over the course of 1 
minute, you can trace a glyph onto the surface of the 
axe, starting with the gem at its center, to recreate 
the effects of the 
symbol
 spell (save DC 17) with the 
following changes:
 
y
 The glyph you create as part of the spell exists on 
the axe and moves with it.
 
y
 The glyph can only be triggered when you hit a 
creature with the axe. Once that creature makes 
a saving throw against the glyph’s effect, the spell 
ends.
 
y
 The spell only affects the target that triggered the 
glyph.
 
y
 Aberrations and undead have disadvantage on the 
saving throw to resist the spell’s effects.
Once this property of the axe has been used, it can’t 
be used again until 12 hours have passed. You can only 
have one glyph on the axe in this way at a time.
"
Red Queen’s Burden,"Weapon (glaive), legendary (requires attunement)
This brass, battle-scarred glaive was famously wielded 
by a tyrannical queen. You must have a Strength score of 
17 or higher to wield this weapon. The queen’s intensity 
still burns inside this weapon, making its handle always 
warm to the touch. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals 
an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits.
The glaive has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 
expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, a 
magical, illusory crown appears on your head. The 
crown is brass and has a number of horns equal to the 
number of charges the weapon has remaining. When 
you expend 1 or more charges from the glaive, the horns 
adorning the illusory crown burn away in a shower of 
embers.
While holding the glaive, you can expend 1 or more of 
its charges to impose your will on the creatures around 
you, using the following commands:
“Cower.”
 When you hit a target with the glaive, you 
can expend 2 charges to exude an imposing aura of 
dominance. All hostile creatures within 15 feet of you 
must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be 
frightened of you until the end of your next turn. The 
target of the attack has disadvantage on this saving 
throw.
“Execute.”
 Immediately after you make an attack with 
the glaive as part of the Attack action, you can expend 
1 charge to command a willing creature other than you 
to use its reaction to make one weapon attack. The 
creature must be able to see and hear you. If the attack 
hits, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage.
“Survive.”
 As a bonus action, you can expend 1 
or more charges to grant a creature other than you a 
number of temporary hit points equal to 5 times the 
number of charges you expend, plus your Strength 
modifier. The creature must be able to see and hear you.
Alternatively, while holding the glaive, you can expend 
2 of its charges at the start of your turn (no action 
required) to become an unyielding pillar of defense. 
When you do, your movement speed becomes 0 and you 
gain the following benefits until the start of your next 
turn:
 
y
 You gain a +2 bonus to AC.
 
y
 You can use your reaction up to three times, instead 
of once, before the start of your next turn. You can 
use no more than one reaction per turn.
 
y
 When a creature within 10 feet of you makes an 
attack against you or another target, you can use 
your reaction to make a melee attack with the glaive 
against the attacking creature.
 
y
 When you hit a creature with an attack using the 
glaive, that creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, its speed becomes 0 
until the start of its next turn.
Flaw.
 The 
Red Queen’s burden
 makes its wielder 
angry and untrusting. While attuned to the weapon, you 
gain the following flaw: “I can only trust one person. 
Everyone else is either a subject, a threat, or both.” You 
or your GM determine who you can trust. In addition, if 
you are attuned to the weapon for 24 consecutive hours, 
your hotheadedness leaves your mind open to weakness 
and distraction. You are vulnerable to psychic damage 
and have disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) 
checks. These effects can be removed with a 
greater 
restoration
 spell, but not while you are attuned to the 
weapon.
"
Redeemer’s Regards,"Weapon (longbow), rare (requires attunement by a paladin)
A bow designed for holy warriors who prefer to keep 
evil at a distance. Any ranged attack you make with this 
weapon is considered to be a melee weapon attack for 
the purposes of using your Divine Smite feature and 
meeting the requirements of any paladin spell you cast 
with “smite” in its name.  
In addition, when you expend a 1st-level spell slot to 
use your Divine Smite feature on an attack made with 
this bow, you can choose to not expend the spell slot 
instead. This property can’t be used again until the next 
dawn.
"
Redsmith Crucible Set,"Wondrous item, common
This set of magic smith’s tools from the dwarven 
Redsmith family includes a stone crucible that’s been 
enchanted with minor transmutation magic. If you are 
proficient with smith’s tools or are a dwarf, you can use 
an action to speak the tools’ command word and lower 
a nonmagical weapon made of metal into the crucible 
and hold it there for 10 minutes. At the end of that 
time, make a DC 10 Strength check using the smith’s 
tools. On a success, the weapon is magically reforged. 
A reforged weapon counts as magical, and when you 
pull the reforged weapon from the crucible, you can 
change it into another type of weapon that shares the 
same properties as the original one. For example, a light 
hammer could become a handaxe, or a longsword could 
become a warhammer. These benefits last for 24 hours, 
at which point the weapon becomes nonmagical once 
more and returns to its original form.
Once this property of the tools has been used, it can’t 
be used again for 24 hours. In the meantime, the tools 
can still be used as magic smith’s tools.
"
Redsmith Hammer,"Weapon (light hammer), common
This dwarven smithing hammer has runes running from 
end to end. When beaten against an anvil, the runes 
around the hammer glow a bright red and emanate 
heat, allowing a blacksmith to use the hammer to mold 
weapons and armor using only the hammer and anvil.
"
Rejuvenating Draft,"Potion, rarity varies
When you drink this potion, you regain 1d3 + 1 
(uncommon), 1d4 + 3 (rare), 1d6 + 4 (very rare), or 
all (legendary) spent Hit Dice. When you drink the 
legendary variant of a 
rejuvenating draft
, your age is 
reduced by 1d4 years (to a minimum of 1 year old).
"
Reliquary of Holy Memories,"Rod, rarity varies (requires attunement by a cleric or 
paladin)
This scepter holds the bones of a powerful martyred 
saint and are said to contain the echoes of their 
memories. The rod can also be used as a magic mace.
While attuned to this rod, you can prepare one 
additional spell for each bone held within the rod, 
up to a maximum of 5. The rarity of the reliquary is 
determined by the number of bones inside. Use the table 
below to determine the number of extra spells you can 
prepare while attuned to a 
reliquary of holy memories

Riff’s Dimensional Ripper,"Weapon (dagger), uncommon (requires attunement)
This roughly forged dagger of goblin make has somehow 
been enchanted with weak, planar magic. This magic 
dagger has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges 
daily at dawn. While holding the dagger within 5 feet of 
a creature at least one size larger than you, you can use 
an action to expend 1 of the dagger’s charges to create 
and slip through a brief, planar tear, reappearing in an 
unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature on the 
opposite side of it. When you do, you can immediately 
make one weapon attack with this dagger against that 
creature. If the attack hits, that creature takes an extra 
1d6 force damage and can’t take reactions until the end 
of your turn.
If using the dagger in this way would cause you to 
move more than 20 feet, you are shunted out of the 
planar tear and reappear in your original space instead. 
When this happens, you take 4d6 force damage, and the 
action is wasted.
"
Rift Sheath,"Weapon (quarterstaff or shortsword), rare (requires 
attunement)
This dark, wooden staff is actually a two-sided sheath 
for a pair of equally dark shortswords. While holding the 
staff with two hands, you can use a bonus action to twist 
the staff to sheath or unsheath the two swords from 
it. When unsheathing the swords, the wooden sheath 
is shunted into a special extradimensional space until 
"
Ring of Changing Shapes,"Ring, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)
This magic ring is made of solid mercury that bubbles 
and flows freely around your finger whenever you cast 
a spell. While wearing the ring, you gain the following 
benefits:
Shift Spell.
 When a spell you are casting fails 
because of a 
counterspell
 cast by another creature, you 
can spend 3 sorcery points as a reaction to immediately 
cast a different spell of the same level or lower without 
expending another spell slot. This property can’t be used 
again until the next dawn.
To be eligible, the new spell must have the same 
casting time as the first one and can’t consume any 
material components.
Spell Surge.
 As a bonus action, you can spend 5 
sorcery points to cast a spell no higher than 5th level 
that has a casting time of 1 action, even if you’ve already 
used your action to cast a spell on this turn. When 
you do, you can’t move or take actions until after your 
next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over you. This 
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Ring of Healer’s Heroism,"Ring, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
When you use an action to restore hit points to a 
creature other than yourself while wearing this winged 
ring, you become infused with heroism. You gain 
temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier, 
and until the end of your next turn, you are immune to 
being frightened.
"
Ring of Lunar Might,"Ring, very rare (requires attunement)
This intricate ring has various flowing designs that 
are both entropic and patterned in nature. While 
wearing the ring, you can use an action to create an 
area of gravitational force that extends from you in a 
20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder. The area moves 
with you and remains as long as you concentrate (as if 
concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 10 minutes. 
You have a semblance of control of the gravity within 
this cylinder. A friendly creature other than you spends 1 
foot of movement for every 2 feet it moves within
 the area, while hostile creatures must spend 2 feet of 
movement for every 1 foot moved instead.
For the duration, you can use a bonus action on 
each of your turns to try and overwhelm a creature 
that you can see within the cylinder with a wave of 
intense gravity. Such a creature must succeed on a DC 
16 Strength saving throw or take 2d10 bludgeoning 
damage and be knocked prone. In addition, you can use 
a bonus action on your turn to pull or push any water 
within the area up to 20 feet toward you or away from 
you, up to the outside of the cylinder. This effect lasts 
for the duration of the cylinder or until you use a bonus 
action to change the water’s direction or end the effect.
Once the ring has been used to create an area of 
gravitational force, it can’t do so again until the next 
dusk.
Alternatively, you can use an action to speak the ring’s 
command word to cast the 
reverse gravity
 spell (spell 
DC 16) from it. Once the ring has been used in this way, 
it loses this property.
"
Ring of Misdirection,"Ring, rare
This dark silver ring is covered in chiseled, dune-like 
swirls that seem to shift and change throughout the 
day. When found, this ring has 1d3 + 3 charges. While 
wearing the ring, you can use your reaction whenever 
you’re hit by an opportunity attack to expend 1 of the 
ring’s charges to cast the 
mislead
 spell. When you do, 
your illusory double is hit by the attack, instead of you, 
and you and the double can immediately move up to 
your remaining speed without provoking opportunity 
attacks. This version of the spell doesn’t require 
concentration, but lasts until the end of your next turn, 
instead of 1 hour. The ring becomes nonmagical when 
you use the last charge.
"
Ring of Rituals,"Ring, uncommon
While wearing this ring, you can speak its command 
word to cause a small, illusory flame to appear above it. 
The flame emits light like a normal candle but doesn’t 
require oxygen or give off heat. Speaking the command 
word again snuffs out the light.
In addition, when you cast the ritual version of a spell, 
you can use the ring as a material component of the 
"
Ring of Solar’s Sight,"Ring, rare (requires attunement)
This gilded ring has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 
expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, 
you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges 
to cast the 
hunter’s mark
 spell from it, which lasts for 
1 minute. You gain a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls 
made against any target you mark with the spell in 
this way, and on a hit, the attack deals radiant damage 
instead of the weapon’s normal damage type.
"
Ring of Stolen Alacrity,"Ring, uncommon
This ring has a loose outer layer that’s covered with 
illustrations of a person caught in various stages of 
running. If you spin the outer layer, the person appears 
to animate and run.
If you aren’t surprised while wearing this ring, you can 
use your reaction when you roll for initiative to spin the 
ring and speak its command word. You use this reaction 
after you know the initiative order, if the GM shares it 
with you, but before any creature takes its turn. Choose 
a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you that 
also rolled for initiative. That creature must succeed on 
a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or swap the total of its 
initiative roll with yours. A willing creature can choose 
to fail this saving throw. Once this property of the ring 
has been used, it can’t be used again until the next 
dawn.
If the GM doesn’t share the initiative order with you, 
you can choose up to three creatures that you can 
see within 30 feet of you as part of this reaction. You 
immediately learn whether each of those creatures acts 
before or after you in the initiative order. Afterward, 
choose one of those creatures to make the saving throw 
as normal.
"
Ring of Volleys,"Ring, uncommon
While wearing this ring, you can choose to summon 
a nocked arrow or bolt whenever you draw a bow or 
crossbow. The ammunition is magical. An arrow or bolt 
vanishes if you don’t fire it right away and disappears 
right after it hits or misses.
"
Ring of the Arcane Berserker,"Ring, rare (requires attunement by a barbarian)
This dark silver ring is decorated by a metallic skull 
with an amethyst gemstone embedded in its forehead. 
While wearing the ring, you can use an action to cast the 
chill touch
 spell (+5 to hit with ranged spell attack) from 
it.
This ring has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can cast 
a spell even if you’re raging by expending 1 of the 
ring’s charges as part of casting the spell. If you do, 
your rage does not end at the end of your turn as a 
result of not attacking a hostile creature. In addition, 
you can concentrate on spells while raging, but have 
disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain 
your concentration on them when you take damage.
"
Ring of the Assassin Lord,"Ring, legendary (requires attunement by a rogue)
This dagger-shaped ring has been worn by famous 
assassins throughout history. While wearing this ring, 
you can deal your extra Sneak Attack damage twice, 
instead of once, on each of your turns. The two attacks 
must be made against different targets, and the Sneak 
Attack damage for the second attack is halved.
The inside of the ring is blank when you first attune 
to the ring. A small tick mark appears on the band’s 
interior whenever you reduce a creature of challenge 
rating 1 or higher to 0 hit points with an attack in which 
you dealt Sneak Attack damage. Once the ring has 50 
marks, your Dexterity ability score increases by 2, as 
does your maximum for that score, and the ring stops 
adding more marks. If another creature attunes to the 
ring and gains this bonus, your Dexterity ability score 
and maximum for that score return to normal.
"
Ring of the Mute Mage,"Ring, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This dark silver ring looks like a tongue wrapped 
around your finger with an amethyst pressed into it. The 
Undercommon word for “silent” is inscribed into the 
ring’s tongue. While wearing the ring, the same word 
becomes harmlessly written on your own tongue, and 
when you cast a spell of 3rd level or lower that requires 
only verbal components, you can choose to cast the 
spell using somatic ones instead. Any spell that requires 
a target to hear its verbal component gains no benefit 
from this property. Once this property of the ring has 
been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Ring of the Split Mind,"Ring, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This crimson ring is split into two half-circles that 
magically hover a hair’s breadth apart. While wearing 
the ring and concentrating on only one spell, you have 
advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make 
to maintain your concentration on that spell when you 
take damage.
If you’re concentrating on a spell of 3rd level or lower 
and wearing the ring, you can choose to cast another 
spell of 3rd level or lower that also requires concentra-
tion without losing concentration on the first one. While 
concentrating on two spells in this way, make a Constitu-
tion saving throw for each spell as normal whenever you 
take damage to maintain your concentration. When you 
do, roll the d20 for each spell’s saving throw in the order 
in which you cast them. You are vulnerable to psychic 
damage while concentrating on two spells in this way. 
Once this property of the ring has been used, it can’t be 
used again until the next dawn.
"
Rings of the True Companions,"Ring, rare (requires attunement)
These rings typically come in pairs but have been known 
to come in sets of up to four. Each ring is magically 
connected and can be attuned to by a different creature. 
While wearing one of the rings, you can use the 
following property even if you aren’t attuned to it:
When another creature that you can see who is also 
wearing one of the rings drops to 0 hit points, you can 
use your reaction to cause that creature to drop to 1 hit 
point instead. Once this property of the rings has been 
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
If you find an additional 
ring of the true companions
, 
you can add it to an existing set by holding all of the 
rings together for 1 minute. A ring can only be a part of 
one set at a time, and is removed from a set if it’s more 
than 1 mile away from the other rings for 24 consecutive 
hours.
If you are the only creature attuned to one of the rings, 
it gains 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges 
daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an 
action expend 1 of its charges to cast the 
cure wounds
 
spell (spellcasting modifier +3). If the target of the spell 
is another creature wearing one of the rings, the spell’s 
range increases to 30 feet.
If additional creatures are attuned to rings from the 
set, the rings’ collective strength grows and they share a 
pool of charges instead. For each attuned creature after 
the first, the rings gain an extra 2 charges and regain 
another 2 expended charges daily at dawn. The rings 
can share a maximum of 9 charges in this way (1d3 + 6).
The following properties are shared among all attuned 
creatures who are also wearing one of the rings from 
the set. The effects are cumulative and are determined 
by the number of attuned wearers:
2 attuned wearers:
 When you use the rings to cast 
cure wounds
 on another wearer, you can choose to cast 
it using a bonus action instead, but can only cast it once 
on the same turn.
3 attuned wearers:
 When you use the rings to cast 
cure wounds
 on another wearer, its range increases to 
60 feet, and you can increase the spell slot level by one 
for each additional charge you expend, up to 4th level.
4 or more attuned wearers:
 When you use the rings 
to cast 
cure wounds
 on another wearer, you also gain 
1d4 + 1 temporary hit points for each charge you spend.
"
Riptide Crossbow,"Weapon (crossbow, heavy), rare (requires attunement)
This magic crossbow has 3 charges and regains 1d3 
expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you 
can expend 1 of the crossbow’s charges to speak its 
command word and fire a bolt at a point on the ground 
you can see within the weapon’s normal range. The 
"
Roaring Whip,"Weapon (whip), uncommon
This magic whip releases a thunderous burst of sound 
from it when snapped that can damage faraway targets 
with its ferocity.
When you take the Attack action while holding this 
whip, you can use it to attack a target that’s up to 5 feet 
outside your normal reach with the weapon. On a hit, 
the weapon’s damage die changes to a d6 and deals 
thunder damage instead of slashing damage. Hit or 
miss, it emits the sound of a roaring lion audible out to 
100 feet.
"
Rod of Endless Light,"Rod, common
While holding this rod, you can use an action to speak 
its command word. When you do, the rod sheds bright 
light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 
20 feet. The light remains for 1 hour or until you use 
an action speak the rod’s command word again while 
holding it. For the duration, you can use a bonus action 
to mentally change the color of the light while holding 
the rod.
"
Rod of Refstophobia,"Rod, rare
This heavy stake can magically repel liquids in contact 
with it and always feels uncomfortably dry. While hold-
ing the rod, you can use an action to speak its command 
word to cause any freestanding, nonliving liquids within 
10 feet of the rod to be pushed away. You can use the 
rod in this way for up to 1 hour, all at once or in several 
shorter increments, each one using a minimum of 1 
minute from the duration. The rod regains 15 minutes 
of use for every 12 hours it remains inactive.
"
Rod of Reverberation,"Rod, rare (requires attunement)
This rod bears the embossed likeness of an ox at its 
top, where it splits into two horn-like prongs. When 
struck, the prongs reverberate with a magical force and 
electricity.
The rod has 3 charges and regains all expended 
charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can 
use your reaction when another creature hits you with a 
"
Rod of Storms,"Rod, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This silver rod crackles with energy and can redirect 
or release powerful electric surges. While holding it, 
if a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes 
lightning damage, you can use your reaction to halve 
that lightning damage and choose another target you 
can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, that target 
must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 
lightning damage equal to the lightning damage taken by 
the creature.
Spells.
 The rod has 3 charges and regains all 
expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, 
you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast 
the 
lightning bolt
 spell (save DC 15) from it.
In addition, you can use an action to expend 1 of the 
rod’s charges to cast the 
call lightning
 spell (save DC 
15) from it if the spell is on your spell list. If you take 
lightning damage from a bolt of lightning you call down 
in this way, the rod regains 1 expended charge.
"
Rod of Thought Projection,"Rod, uncommon
While holding this rod, you can use an action to create 
a mental connection with a willing humanoid creature 
that you can see within 120 feet of you. The connection 
lasts as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on 
a spell), or until the other creature chooses to close it 
or moves farther than 120 feet away from you. For the 
duration, you can communicate with it telepathically. In 
addition, as part of the action to open this connection 
or as an action on a subsequent turn while it remains 
open, you can choose to see through the creature’s 
eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next 
turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the 
creature has. During this time, you are deaf and blind 
with regard to your own senses.
If the creature is unwilling, it must succeed on a DC 
13 Wisdom saving throw or have the mental connection 
be established anyway. The creature is aware of the 
effect when it makes the saving throw. At the end of each 
of the creature’s turns, it can make another Wisdom 
saving throw. On a success, the connection is severed, 
and the effect ends. Once the rod has been used on an 
unwilling creature in this way, it can’t do so again until 
the next dawn.
"
Rod of Water Absorption,"Rod, rare
This hollow rod has a hole at its end and four sections 
that each magically hold up to 10 gallons of water. Each 
hollow section is capped with a ring of glass, allowing 
you to see inside the rod and know how much water is 
stored within it. The rod weighs 3 pounds, regardless of 
how much water is stored inside.
While holding the open end of the rod underwater, you 
can speak its first command word as an action to cause 
it to begin absorbing water for the next minute. The rod 
can only absorb water. If the rod is submerged in this 
way for the full duration, it absorbs 10 gallons of water. 
The rod can hold up to 40 gallons at any time in this 
way, and can absorb up to 100 each day.
While holding the rod, you can use an action to speak 
its second or third command words. When you speak 
the second command word, you cast the 
create or 
destroy water
 spell (Create Water only) from the rod. 
You can cast the spell at up to 4th level in this way. Each 
gallon of water you create as part of the spell is drawn 
from the pool of water within the rod. If you cast this 
spell from the rod and cause the water to fall as rain, 
the spell consumes 10 gallons of water for each of the 
spell’s slot levels.
Speaking the third command word causes 10 or more 
gallons of water to erupt from the rod in a torrent of 
water, up to the maximum amount remaining within the 
rod. This water is drawn from the pool of water within 
the rod. The water is shot in a line 30 feet long and 1 
foot wide. Any creature in the line must make a DC 15 
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 
2d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 gallons of water 
"
Rod of the Magicycle,"Rod, rare
This sturdy antler rod is capped on either end with a 
plush leather handle. You can twist the two handles in 
opposite directions as an action, releasing an unearthly 
roar audible out to 100 feet and causing the rod to 
magically split apart and form a powerful, two-wheeled 
vehicle made of wood, with the rod’s handles at its front. 
You can twist the handles again as an action to return 
the vehicle to its rod form. The vehicle can appear 
underneath you, with you standing astride it, or in an 
empty space within 5 feet of you (your choice). The 
vehicle is a Medium magical object, called a magicycle, 
and has the following properties:
 
y
 The vehicle has AC 14, 40 hit points, and a speed 
of 60 feet. While moving, its AC becomes 17. When 
underwater, it ceases to function and immediately 
reverts to its rod form.
 
y
 The vehicle weighs 200 pounds. If it falls prone, it 
can’t right itself until a creature within reach pulls it 
upright as an action.
 
y
 One Small or Medium creature drives and steers 
the vehicle. It can carry up to 300 pounds and 
comfortably fits either one Medium creature or two 
smaller ones.
 
y
 If the vehicle moves in a straight line for 600 feet, 
its speed increases to 100 feet until the next time 
it makes a significant turn or until it slows down or 
comes to a stop.
 
y
 For every uninterrupted period of 8 hours that the 
vehicle is in its rod form or goes unmoved, it regains 
1d8 hit points. If it drops to 0 hit points, it reverts 
to its rod form and can’t be used again until 5 days 
have passed.
 
y
 When you make a Dexterity saving throw while 
riding the vehicle, you can use your reaction to 
gain advantage on the roll. On a successful save, 
you can drive the vehicle up to 20 feet as part of 
the reaction. If moving in this way causes you to no 
longer be in the triggering effect’s area, such as an 
ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm 
spell, you instead take no damage, instead of half 
damage, from the effect. On a failed save, you and 
the vehicle fall prone.
"
Rope Caster,"Weapon (crossbow, hand), common
This magic weapon is a favorite among infiltrators. Its 
firing mechanism has no string, unlike other crossbows. 
Instead, this weapon can only be loaded with rope. As 
a bonus action, you can load a length of rope into the 
crossbow. When you do, individual strands from the 
rope magically latch onto the weapon’s limbs and pull 
the mechanism taut. You can make a ranged attack with 
the crossbow to fire the rope at a willing creature or 
an object within range that isn’t being worn or carried. 
If it hits, the target takes no damage from the attack 
but is bound by the rope. If the rope is long enough, it 
magically wraps around the target in a single loop and 
securely ties itself, leaving the remaining rope to hang 
from the knot. If the target is a willing creature, the 
rope ties itself around the creature’s chest or waist as 
a harness but does not restrain them. If the attack hits 
an unwilling creature, the rope falls harmlessly to the 
ground without being tied.
A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 
Strength or Dexterity check, releasing a bound object 
within its reach on a success.
"
Rose Quartz Koi,"Wondrous item, common
This Tiny crystalline sculpture of a fish weighs 2 pounds 
and looks miraculously lifelike. When you place or 
release the sculpture at a point underwater, it comes 
to life and swims around in a 5-foot-cube centered on 
that point. If placed in a container of salt water that’s no 
larger than 5 feet on a side, the water inside becomes 
fresh after 10 minutes. You can use an Action to 
recapture the swimming sculpture.
"
Royal Blade of Amphibios,"Weapon (rapier), very rare (requires attunement)
This expertly crafted blade is ornamented with rose gold 
designs of frogs and lily pads. While holding the rapier, 
you can stand on and move across any liquid surface as 
if it were solid ground, you can hold your breath for up 
to 30 minutes at a time, and you gain a swimming speed 
of 30 feet. In addition, any creature with the Amphibious 
trait can understand the meaning of your words 
when you speak, though you gain no special ability to 
understand them in return.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. In addition, the blade has 
3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at 
dawn. When you take the Attack action while holding 
the weapon, you can choose to expend 1 of its charges 
to transform the blade into a lashing, silver pseudopod 
that loosely resembles a frog’s tongue. Until the end of 
your turn, the weapon adds 10 feet to your reach when 
you attack with it and deals slashing damage, instead 
of piercing, and on a hit, the target must succeed on a 
DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet 
straight toward you.
"
Royal Incinerator,"Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, 
warlock, or wizard)
This crimson and gold staff exudes authority and 
is always warm to the touch. While held, a mote of 
harmless fire sparks into life and floats above its crown-
like head.
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that 
grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
it. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d8 fire damage. 
You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this 
staff.
The staff has 15 charges for the following properties. 
The staff regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, 
the staff erupts into a pillar of flame and is destroyed. 
The flames erupt in a 20-foot-radius cylinder that’s 80 
feet tall. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 
Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 fire damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Protective Flame.
 When a creature that you can see 
hits you with an attack while you’re holding the staff, you 
can use your reaction to expend any number of charges 
from the staff to reduce the attack’s damage against you 
by an amount equal to 5 times the number of charges 
you expend. If the attacker is within 5 feet of you, it also 
takes fire damage equal to the amount of damage that 
was reduced in this way.
Spells.
 While holding this staff, you can use an action 
to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the 
following spells from it, using your spell save DC and 
spell attack bonus: 
fire shield
 (4 charges, warm shield 
only), 
fireball
 (3 or more charges), or 
scorching ray
 (2 or 
more charges). When you cast 
fireball
 or 
scorching ray
 
from the staff in this way, you can increase the spell slot 
level by one for each additional charge you expend.
"
Rust Arrow,"Weapon (arrow), uncommon
Rust arrows
 are typically made in sets of 5 using the 
remains of a rust monster’s antennae and chitinous 
hide. When found, a quiver of 
rust arrows
 contains 1d3 
+ 2 of the magic ammunition. Once it hits a target, an 
arrow flakes away into dust and is destroyed.
When you make a ranged attack with a 
rust arrow
 
and hit a target that is either wearing nonmagical 
metal armor or holding a nonmagical metal shield 
or weapon, that armor or weapon takes a permanent 
and cumulative –1 penalty to its AC or damage rolls, 
respectively. You choose what object takes the penalty. If 
an armor’s penalty reduces its AC to 10 or its bonus to 
AC to +0, or if a weapon’s penalty drops to –5, the object 
is destroyed.
If the target is a nonmagical ferrous metal object that 
isn’t being worn or carried, the arrow destroys a 1-foot 
cube of it.
"
Sagittarian Vestments,"Armor (light, medium, or heavy), uncommon (requires 
attunement by a cleric or paladin)
This armor is covered by a tabard that bears a cross-
like symbol with an arrow at its top. While attuned to 
the armor, its symbol changes to represent the mark of 
your deity. You can benefit from the armor, as described 
below, even if you aren’t attuned to it.
While wearing this armor, you have advantage on 
Wisdom (Medicine) checks, and you can use a bonus 
action to speak the armor’s command word and touch a 
dying creature to magically stabilize them.
While attuned to this armor and wearing it, you can 
use a bonus action to cast the 
spiritual weapon
 spell 
from it, using a spell attack bonus of +5 and spellcasting 
ability modifier of +2. This version of the spell causes 
the summoned weapon to take the form of a bow that 
shares your space and moves with you, as opposed to 
moving independently. The bow makes ranged spell 
attacks, instead of melee ones, with spectral arrows 
that have a range of 30 feet. Once the armor has been 
used to cast this spell, it can’t cast it again until the next 
dawn. Additionally, when you stabilize a creature using 
this armor’s command word, roll a d20. On a 20, the 
creature regains 1 hit point.
Curse.
 This armor is cursed, and becoming attuned to 
it extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the 
remove curse
 spell. While cursed, your legs magically 
change shape to become hooved and equine, unless 
they already are, and you take a –5 penalty to Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks. In addition, while cursed, the distance 
you can jump without a running start is halved.
"
Salamander Flame Gauntlets,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
These dark metal gauntlets were forged using fire from 
the heart of a salamander. While wearing them, your 
unarmed strikes with your hands deal an extra 1d4 fire 
damage to any target they hit. In addition, you can use 
a bonus action to cast the 
flame blade
 spell (4th-level 
version, no concentration required) from the gauntlets, 
"
Sash of Sorcerous Synergy,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)
This miraculous, one-shouldered robe is made from fine 
fabrics that have been steeped in powerful magic and 
fastened with an ornate buckle. The sash has 5 charges 
and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. 
When an ally that you can see within 60 feet of you 
casts a spell while you’re wearing this robe, you can use 
your reaction to expend 1 or more of the sash’s charges 
to twist the spell with one of your known Metamagic 
options, without spending any sorcery points. The 
number of charges you expend is equal to the number 
of sorcery points the Metamagic option would normally 
cost. If using the sash would cause the spell to target a 
second creature, you choose the new target.
In addition, when you use a Metamagic option on 
a spell while wearing this sash, you can change the 
style, color, and material of the garment and buckle. 
The sash’s weight doesn’t change. Regardless of its 
appearance, the sash can’t be anything but a one-
shouldered robe.
"
Satchel of Beast Chow,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This hefty satchel is 1 foot tall, weighs 2 pounds, and 
has 2d4 + 2 servings of magical, nondescript food inside 
it when found. The morsels of food come in small, half-
inch cubes and smell as if they could have been made of 
either savory meats, enriched plants, or both. If a beast 
or monstrosity with a challenge rating of 2 or lower 
and an Intelligence of 3 or lower eats a serving of this 
food from your hand or similar outstretched vessel, it 
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be 
charmed by you for 1 hour. While charmed, the creature 
regards you and your companions as friends, and you 
have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) and 
Charisma checks made to interact with the creature. 
If the creature takes any damage from you or your 
companions for the duration, the charm ends early. 
If the charm lasts for the full duration, the creature 
remains nonhostile toward you until you threaten it.
"
Scarlet Scourge,"Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement)
This whip is made from the severed vertebrae of a slain 
vampire’s victims. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
The whip siphons blood from creatures that it hits. 
Whenever you hit a Small or larger living creature with 
the whip that is not a construct, ooze, plant, or undead, 
the bone blade at its end absorbs some of its blood and 
gains 1 charge. The whip can hold up to 10 charges and 
loses its charges whenever you finish a short or long 
rest. While holding the whip, you can use a bonus action 
to speak its command word to convert these charges 
into healing energy. When you do, the whip loses all its 
charges and you regain 2 hit points for each charge lost.
For every 5 charges the whip has, the muscle fibers 
that hold it together loosen and add 5 feet to the 
weapon’s reach.
"
Scepter of Faith,"Rod, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric)
This rod is imbued with the last remaining magic from 
a pious saint. While holding the rod, you can use a 
bonus action to cast the 
shield of faith
 spell from it on a 
creature other than you within range. When an attacker 
within 60 feet of you deals damage to a creature under 
the effect of this spell, you can use your reaction to 
cause a spectral shield to appear before it and push the 
attacker 5 feet away from the creature.
In addition, while holding the rod, you can use an 
action to cast either the 
guardian of faith
 or 
find the

 can only

a 3rd-level spell from it, using your reaction. Once the

curses you until you are targeted by the

spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end 
the curse. While cursed, you have disadvantage on 
saving throws to resist becoming charmed, and you have 
disadvantage on Charisma checks to interact with any 
creature you find attractive.
"
Scorpio Armor,"Armor (half plate or plate), uncommon (requires 
attunement)
This armor is made from the treated carapace of a giant 
scorpion. You can benefit from the armor, as described 
below, even if you aren’t attuned to it.
While wearing this armor, it doesn’t impose 
disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks while 
you’re in dim light or darkness. However, your speed 
is reduced by 5 feet while you’re in sunlight, as the 
armored husk recoils and constricts from it.
While attuned to this armor and wearing it, you have 
advantage on saving throws against poison. In addition, 
you can use a bonus action to close your eyes and 
speak the armor’s command word. When you do, you 
create an instantaneous pulse of awareness around you, 
immediately alerting you to the presence and location of 
any creature within 30 feet of you that’s on the ground 
as if you had tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet. Once 
the armor’s command word has been used, it can’t be 
used again until the next dusk.
"
Scorpion Lasher,"Weapon (whip), uncommon (requires attunement)
This whip was constructed using salvaged pieces of a 
giant scorpion and drips with a sickly venom. Once on 
each of your turns when you hit a creature with this 
weapon, you can cause the whip to deal an extra 1d6 
poison damage. When you do, if the creature is Medium 
or smaller, it must also succeed on a DC 13 Strength 
saving throw or be pulled 5 feet closer to you.
"
Scroll of Mapping,"Scroll, uncommon or very rare
By using an action to read the scroll, you cause the 
arcane script on the page to vanish and become an inked 
map of the surrounding area. The map shows the area 
in a 1-mile radius centered on the point where you read 
the scroll and indicates both structures and topography. 
By touching the map, a small light appears at your 
location to indicate where you are. Using a series of 
natural gestures when touching the page, you can cause 
the map to change its scale or displayed portion of the 
area. The scroll isn’t destroyed when you read it, but 
can’t be used again to create a different map.
The following 
scroll of mapping
 is a very rare variant 
with additional properties.
This map is in color and displays the names of large 
and small locations, depending on the map’s scale, 
such as the name of the region, street, or nearby shop. 
In addition, you can use an action to touch the map 
and ask it where a familiar person or place is that you 
can name or clearly describe. If the person or place is 
somewhere that can be shown on the map, an X appears 
on it at the target’s location. If there are multiple targets 
with the same name or description within the area, 
multiple marks appear. If the target is a creature that’s 
in a different form, such as being under the effects of a 
polymorph
 spell, or can’t be detected by divination magic 
or scrying sensors, the map doesn’t display its location. 
If the target is moving, the X follows its movements for 
the duration. The marked target remains shown on the 
map for 10 minutes, after which time the X vanishes. 
Once this property of the map has been used, it can’t be 
used again until 12 hours have passed.
"
Scroll of Nightmares,"Scroll, rare
Using an action to read this dark scroll causes horrify-
ing memories, fears, and regrets to violently invade the 
minds of up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can 
see within 60 feet of you. Each creature must make a 
DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a crea-
ture takes 5d10 psychic damage and becomes fright-
ened of you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. On a 
successful save, a creature takes half as much psychic 
damage and isn’t frightened. At the GM’s discretion, 
non-sentient creatures, such as some constructs, oozes, 
plants, and undead, are immune to this effect.
Reading the scroll causes its script to flash and burn 
away as each word is spoken. Once the scroll has been 
used, it turns to ash and is destroyed, releasing a final 
wail as its magic is consumed.
"
Scroll of the Jester,"Scroll, rare
Using an action to read this scroll, your appearance 
magically changes to become a jester. At the same time, 
8 perfect illusions of jesters that are identical to you 
appear in random unoccupied spaces within 30 feet 
of you. When the jesters appear, each creature of your 
choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 
Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you as if you 
had cast the 
enthrall
 spell (no concentration required).

Second Fiddle,"Wondrous item, uncommon
A hand-me-down fiddle that’s been enchanted over time 
by the sheer number of bards to have played it. You have 
a +3 bonus to Charisma (Performance) checks made 
with this fiddle. In addition, if you’re a bard and are hold-
ing the fiddle when a creature other than you who can 
see and hear you rolls a Bardic Inspiration die, you can 
use your reaction to play a magical note on the fiddle. 
When you do, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspira-
tion die again and choose either result. You can use this 
reaction before or after the creature rolls the Bardic 
Inspiration die, but before the GM says whether the roll 
succeeds or fails. Once this property has been used, it 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Seeker’s Compass,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This brass compass has two needles: one large, and one 
small. The large needle always indicates magnetic north 
and is unaffected by magical effects that would other-
wise mislead it. The small needle remains motionless 
until activated.
While holding this compass, you can speak its 
command word as an action to cast the 
locate object
 
spell from it and activate the smaller needle. This 
version of the spell has a duration of 1 hour, doesn’t 
require concentration, and causes the smaller needle to 
indicate the direction of the object located by the spell. 
If the small needle can’t detect the object specified by 
the spell, it spins wildly for a moment and then becomes 
motionless again. Once used, this property of the 
compass can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Seer’s Starlight Cloak,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, 
druid, or wizard)
This deep purple cloak is hemmed with a silver lining 
that radiates into starburst patterns around the head 
and arms. When in darkness, tiny stars can be seen 
from within the cloak’s fabric. A constellation of stars in 
the shape of an eye can always be seen on the front of 
the cloak’s dramatic hood. While wearing the cloak, you 
can use an action to cast the 
guidance
 spell.
While you can see the night sky and are wearing the 
cloak, you can use an action to cast the 
augury
 spell. 
When you do, the omens are represented by the number 
of shooting stars that appear in the sky:
 
y
 Three or more shooting stars,
 for good results
 
y
 One shooting star,
 for bad results
 
y
 Two shooting stars,
 for both good and bad results
 
y
 Nothing,
 for results that aren’t especially good or 
bad
Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can’t 
be used again until the next dusk.
"
Seraphim’s Stiletto,"Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement by a creature of 
good alignment)
This magic dagger is made from elven gold and a fine 
sliver of unicorn horn. The dagger has a pool of 20 hit 
points that replenishes daily at dawn. As an action, you 
can touch this dagger to a creature you can see within 5 
feet of you and speak its command word. When you do, 
you can restore a number of hit points to that creature 
from the pool, up to the maximum amount remaining in 
the pool.
When you hit an undead creature with a melee attack 
using this dagger, you can expend a number of hit points 
from the pool, up to the maximum amount remaining, as 
part of the attack. When you do, you deal extra radiant 
damage to that creature equal to twice the number of hit 
points you expend in this way.
"
Shadow Tag,"Wondrous item, rare
This silver coin is embossed with the visage of a hooded, 
near-faceless figure with eyes that are always dark. 
While holding the coin, you can use an action to whisper 
its command word and toss it into a creature’s shadow 
that you can see within 10 feet of you. When you do, the 
coin magically dissolves and tags the creature’s shadow, 
causing a smoky, pitch-dark copy of the coin to appear in 
your hand instead.
While you’re within 1000 feet of the tagged creature’s 
shadow, small points of light appear within the dark 
coin’s eyes that look in the shadow’s direction. If the 
dark coin’s eyes are looking toward the shadow, you can 
grasp the coin and use an action to speak its command 
word again, destroying the coin and immediately 
teleporting you to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of 
the tagged creature. Alternatively, when you destroy the 
coin, you can force the tagged creature to make a DC 15 
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature 
teleports to an unoccupied space on solid ground that 
you can see within 15 feet of you. A creature can choose 
to fail the saving throw.
If the tagged creature doesn’t have a shadow, such as 
if it becomes invisible, the dark coin’s eyes disappear 
until the creature’s shadow reappears. The dark coin 
remains for 24 hours or until you destroy it. If the dark 
coin lasts for its full duration, there is a 50 percent 
chance that the normal coin reappears and replaces it. If 
the coin doesn’t reappear at the end of the duration, it’s 
destroyed.
"
Shadow Weaver’s Guise,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a 
spellcaster)
This patchwork gray cloak has three bone clasps at its 
neck. Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals 
damage while wearing this cloak, you can choose to 
change its damage type to necrotic for that casting of the 
spell.
Curse.
 Once you don this cursed cloak, you are 
unwilling to remove it unless you are targeted by the 
remove curse
 spell or similar magic. While wearing 
the cloak, you are considered to be undead whenever 
you are in dim light or darkness. In addition, if you can 
normally cast the 
light
 or 
dancing lights
 cantrips, you 
are unable to cast them while wearing the cloak.
"
Shadowscale Shroud,"Armor (scale mail), legendary (requires attunement)
Enchanted by powerful drow, this dark and shadowy 
dragon scale armor protects you from both damage and 
light. While wearing this armor, you have a +2 bonus to 
AC and resistance to necrotic damage, and if you have 
the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by it.
In addition, this armor doesn’t impose disadvantage 
on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and when you 
attempt to hide in areas of dim light or darkness while 
wearing it, you gain a +5 bonus to the roll.
Shadow Shift.
 While in an area of dim light or 
darkness, you can use an action to turn invisible. You 
remain invisible for up to 10 minutes or until you use 
a bonus action to become visible again. You become 
visible early if you enter an area of bright light or if 
you attack or cast a spell. While you’re invisible in this 
way, you have resistance to all damage except force 
and radiant, and you can use a bonus action to teleport 
up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that 
is also in dim light or darkness. In addition, while 
you’re invisible in this way, you can’t be targeted by any 
divination magic or perceived through magical scrying 
sensors against your will.
Once this property of the armor has been used, it 
shouldn’t be used again until the next dusk. Each time 
it is used again before then, you must expend either 
6 Hit Dice, rolling each one and taking force damage 
equal to the total rolled, or suffer one level of exhaustion 
(your choice). Force damage taken in this way ignores 
resistance and immunity.
"
Shield of the Justicars,"Armor (shield), rare
One of the original arms from the Upheaval, this shield 
can be used to release a magically discordant pulse. 
While holding this shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. 
This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to 
AC.
In addition, the shield has 4 charges and regains 1d4 
expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, when 
a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you casts 
a spell, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the 
shield’s charges and speak its command word. When 
you do, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes a –2 
penalty to its spell attack bonus and saving throw DC 
until the end of the turn, including against the triggering 
spell.
"
Shifter’s Shine,"Potion, common or uncommon
The typical 
shifter’s shine
, a common potion, is a 
specialty alcoholic beverage that causes your face to 
appear more glamorous. For 1 hour after drinking 
this potion, your skin’s complexion clears, appears 
healthier, and grows more taut. Your face, while largely 
unchanged, is distinctly more attractive and exudes a 
weak aura of enchantment magic. When you make a 
Charisma check while under the effects of this potion, 
you can choose to forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on 
the die. Once you use this property, you can’t use it again 
for the remainder of the potion’s duration. The potion is 
a rich honey color and swirls lazily around, regardless 
of how it’s handled. It can be found in any sort of vessel, 
though it is usually found in glass jars. The eye of a 
shapeshifter drifts along the potion’s bottom, making it 
a daunting beverage for the average taverngoer to order. 
It has an extremely strong alcoholic taste with a hint of 
caramel. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within 
this potion affects a creature twice as much as the 
alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
The following 
shifter’s shine
 is an uncommon variant 
with additional properties. It also tastes better.
When you drink this potion, you gain the effects of the 
alter self
 spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or 
until you end the effect as a bonus action.
"
Shimmering Spectacles,"Wondrous item, common
While wearing these glasses, you can use a bonus action 
to cause them to briefly shine. When you do, the glasses 
cast bright light in a 5-foot radius and obscure your eyes 
until the end of your turn.
"
Shipwright’s Watch,"Wondrous item, common
This glimmering spyglass is actually coated in a fine 
layer of fool’s gold. While peering through the spyglass, 
you can rotate a ring at the front of the telescope to 
toggle between looking directly ahead of you or directly 
behind you, as if you were turned around.
"
Shooting Star,"Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)
Tiny specks of starlight gleam from the dark surface 
of this magic longbow at night. The bow is strung with 
an invisible string that appears only when it’s drawn. 
When pulled, the string emits a soft yellow glow as 
motes of starlight appear and float around the bow’s 
frame. Drawing the bow without first nocking an arrow 
creates a magic arrow of pure starlight in its place and 
intensifies the bow’s glow. The starlit arrow shines 
bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an 
additional 20 feet. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this weapon when you use 
a starlit arrow, which deals radiant damage instead 
of piercing damage. Hit or miss, the starlit arrow 
disappears immediately after the attack.
Falling Stars.
 As an action, you can speak the bow’s 
command word and fire a starlit arrow into the air above 
you, choosing a point that you can see within 60 feet 
of you. The arrow immediately vanishes and creates 
a shower of tiny, magical stars that fall and land in a 
30-foot-radius circle on the ground centered on the point 
you chose. Each creature of your choice within the area 
must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A target 
takes 3d6 radiant damage and 3d6 force damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one, as a shower of magical stars slam into the ground 
around them. This property can’t be used again until the 
next dusk.
In addition, when you use a starlit arrow and roll 
a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, a tiny 
magical star appears and strikes the target. The target 
must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 
radiant damage and 1d6 force damage on a failed save, 
or half as much damage on a successful one.
Immediately after a falling star hits the ground or a 
target, it disappears.
"
Siege Staff,"Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, 
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)
This stony staff has been carved into the shape of a 
castle tower. The staff has 10 charges for the following 
properties, which use your spell save DC and spell 
attack bonus, and regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges 
daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. 
On a 1, a the staff crumbles into rubble and is destroyed.
Battering Strike.
 This staff can be wielded as a 
magic quarterstaff. When you hit with a melee attack 
using this staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause 
the target to take an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If 
the target is a creature, it’s also pushed 5 feet away from 
you. In addition, when you attack an object with the staff 
and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the 
target.
Fire Pot.
 While holding the staff, you can use an 
action and expend 1 or more charges to cast the 
grease
 
spell from it. You can increase the size of the square 
covered by the spell by 5 feet for each additional charge 
you expend in this way (up to a 20-foot square). When 
you expend 2 or more charges to cast the spell in this 
way, creatures also take 2d6 fire damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Trebuchet.
 While holding the staff, you can use an 
action and expend 3 charges to magically create and 
fling a boulder at a point you can see within 60 feet of 
you. Any target within 5 feet of the point must make a 
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 
4d8 bludgeoning damage, and if it’s Medium or smaller, 
it is also pushed 10 feet away from the point. On a 
successful save, a target takes half as much bludgeoning 
damage and isn’t pushed. Maximize the bludgeoning 
damage dice against any object or structure hit by the 
boulder. After it lands, the boulder disappears.
"
Silver Coin of Duvra,"Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)
This silver coin is embossed with the trickster dragon 
Duvra on one side (heads), and a sailing ship on the 
other (tails). Whenever you or another creature you 
can see flips this coin, you can control whether it lands 
heads, tails, or on its side.
"
Silver Eagle Studded Cuirass,"Armor (studded leather), uncommon (requires attunement)
This studded leather armor is worn by an elite guard 
of a longstanding alliance between elves and humans. 
While you’re wearing it, any critical hit against you 
becomes a normal hit.
In addition, when a creature you can see hits you with 
a melee attack while you’re wearing this armor, you can 
use your reaction to speak its command word. When you 
do, a pair of ghostly eagle wings appear from the back of 
the armor. The wings beat the air around you and push 
you back up to 10 feet away from the attacking creature, 
without provoking opportunity attacks. In addition, the 
sudden movement takes you out of harms way, reducing 
the damage you take from the triggering attack by 2d6. 
Once this property of the armor has been used, it can’t 
be used again until the next dawn.
"
Silver Star Cane,"Weapon (rapier), common
This magic rapier is indistinguishable from a cane 
while stowed in its leather-wrapped wooden sheath. 
You can press a button on top of the cane to extend its 
handle upward (no action required), revealing a more 
comfortable grip with which to wield it. The rapier is 
adorned with eight pearls in the form of a heavenly 
constellation. When you draw the weapon, the pearls 
shed bright light in a line 5 feet long and 1 inch wide 
until the end of your turn. The line always points north.
"
Sir Varion’s Helm,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This helm was worn by the iconic hero Sir Varion, 
whose feats of fearlessness preceded him wherever he 
traveled. While wearing the helm, you can hold your 
breath for up to three times the normal duration.
In addition, when you make a saving throw against 
being frightened, you can roll a d6 and add the number 
rolled to the save. This property can’t be used again until 
the next dawn.
"
Sir Varion’s Lance,"Weapon (lance), uncommon (requires attunement)
This weighty lance was originally designed for Sir 
Varion, a brave knight with a famous disregard for 
horses. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. This weapon has the 
heavy property, but is uniquely balanced to function well 
in close-quarters combat. Attacking a target within 5 feet 
of you with this weapon doesn’t impose disadvantage on 
the attack roll.
If you are attuned to 
Sir Varion’s shield
, you can wield 
this weapon with one hand, instead of two, while also 
holding the shield.
"
Sir Varion’s Mantle,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This sturdy, waterproof riding cape once belonged to 
Sir Varion, a famed knight known for his charm and 
eccentricity. While wearing this cape, you can spend 
10 minutes to cast the 
find steed
 spell from it. When 
you do, the summoned steed is in the form of a giant 
toad. The steed remains for the duration or until your 
attunement to the mantle ends. When the steed drops 
to 0 hit points, this property can’t be used again until 2 
days have passed.
In addition, while you’re mounted, you have advantage 
on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.
"
Sir Varion’s Shield,"Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement)
This large shield once belonged to Sir Varion, a noble 
knight who strode bravely through battles on ice, sand, 
or swamp. While holding this shield, you ignore non-
magical difficult terrain and have a +1 bonus to AC. This 
bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.
"
Sky Anchor,"Weapon (spear), rare
This barbed spear was designed to hunt and trap flying 
creatures. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage 
rolls made with this magic weapon, which has a normal 
throwing range of 40 feet. When you hit with a ranged 
attack using this weapon, you can speak its command 
word to create a magical chain that extends from the 
spear to a point on the ground within 5 feet of you. 
When you do, the spear remains lodged in the target. 
Until the spear is dislodged, that target can’t move 
farther away from the point, and at the end of each of 
its turns, the target is pulled up to 10 feet closer to the 
"
Skyglider Shield,"Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)
This rust-colored shield is made from the scales and 
leathery hide of a wyvern. While holding the shield, 
you have resistance to poison damage. In addition, the 
shield has 3 charges and regains all expended charges 
daily at dawn. When you fall while holding the shield, 
you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the shield’s 
charges to cause a pair of wyvern wings to magically 
outstretch from the shield. While the wings remain 
outstretched, you fall at a rate of 10 feet per round and 
gain a flying speed of 30 feet, which you can use to glide 
horizontally as you descend so long as you hold onto 
the shield. If you land on the ground while falling in this 
way, you take no damage from falling. You can’t Dash 
while using the shield to fly, and this flying speed can’t 
be increased in any way. You can use the shield to gain 
altitude when flying in this way, but must spend 3 feet 
of movement for every 1 foot you fly upward. The wings 
refold immediately if you land or at the end of your turn 
if you didn’t fly at least 15 feet on that turn.
"
Skylit Greaves,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
These mithral greaves feel weightless, despite being 
made from metal. While wearing the boots, small jets of 
storming vapor pour from their sides when you move. 
While wearing the greaves, you are always under the 
effect of the 
jump
 spell, your movement speed increas-
es by 10 feet, and you have resistance to lightning and 
thunder damage.
The greaves have 5 charges and regain 1d4 + 1 
expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the 
greaves, you can stomp the ground or tap your heels 
together as an action and expend 1 of their charges to 
create one of the following effects, or 2 charges to create 
both at the same time.

equal to your walking speed and can hover for 10 
minutes.
 
y
 You summon a battering whirlwind around you. Any 
creature within 5 feet of you must make a DC 17 
Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature 
takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage and is flung up to 20 
feet away from you and knocked prone. If a thrown 
target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the 
target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 
“Sir Varion!
Please come help me! A dreadful green dragon has taken 
me hostage in his dreadful lair! It smells dreadful in here!
Please save me, my darling knight!
—Princess Wingwumms of the Amphibious Court”
“Dearest Princess,
I will come with great haste to your aid. No creature 
of any color, size, shape, origin, language, age… (the list 
continues with several repeated options over the next few 
lines) …or orientation will stop me from saving you from 
its malicious clutches. Rest assured, my Lady, your hero is 
coming as quickly as my legs can carry me!
Stay strong, Princess Wingwumms. May the fresh tide 
grace your skin.
—Sir Varion
Postscript: Do tell the dragon, won’t you? I eagerly await 
our dramatic encounter when I find you and its dastardly 
lair!”
"
Slaying Longbow,"Weapon (longbow), legendary (requires attunement by a 
good-aligned creature)
This powerful longbow originally served a solar, one of 
the mighty celestials that guard the heavens from evil. 
Normally unwieldy in the hands of mortals, this bow was 
bestowed upon a heroic human centuries ago and has 
been carefully passed down ever since. When you hit a 
creature with a ranged attack using this magic weapon, 
it takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.
In addition, when you roll a 20 on a ranged attack 
roll made with this bow against a creature that has 
fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 
15 Constitution saving throw or die. On a success, a 
creature takes an extra 6d8 radiant damage from the hit 
instead. A creature automatically succeeds on the saving 
throw if it is good-aligned or has legendary actions.
"
Sleepytime Sheep Stuffy,"Wondrous item, common
This small, soft stuffed sheep toy is 6 inches from 
head to tail and smells like lavender. A willing creature 
holding the stuffy can use an action to speak its 
command word to immediately fall asleep. This property 
can’t be used again for 8 hours.
"
Snake Charmer’s Flute,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
You must be proficient with wind instruments to use this 
flute. While you are attuned to the flute, ordinary snakes 
are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless 
you threaten or harm them. For the purposes of this 
item, this includes flying snakes, poisonous snakes, and 
constrictor snakes, although swarms and giant versions 
of such creatures have a 50 percent chance of being 
indifferent to you instead.
You can use an action to play the flute. While you 
continue to play the flute each round as an action, any 
snake that comes within 30 feet of you and isn’t under 
another creature’s control must make a Wisdom check 
contested by your Charisma check. If you lose the con-
test, the snake behaves as it normally would and can’t be 
swayed by the flute’s music for the next 24 hours. If you 
win the contest, the snake is swayed by the flute’s music 
and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as 
long as you continue to play the instrument. A friendly 
snake obeys your mental commands. If you issue no 
commands to a friendly snake, it defends itself but oth-
erwise takes no actions. If a friendly snake starts its turn 
and can’t hear the flute’s music, your control over that 
snake ends, and the snake behaves as it normally would 
and can’t be swayed by the flute’s music for the next 24 
hours. Your control over a snake ends early if you or 
your companions do anything harmful to it.
"
Snow Rider’s Sleigh,"Wondrous item, common
This magic sled moves effortlessly over land as if it 
were covered in fresh snow and sends small flurries of 
illusory snowflakes behind it as it travels.
"
Soul Pendant,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This mithral pendant holds a cleanly cut diamond at its 
center and hangs from a string of polished prayer beads. 
The pendant has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. When a creature that you can 
see within 60 feet of you dies while you’re wearing this 
necklace, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the 
pendant’s charges and speak its command word. When 
you do, that creature’s soul becomes trapped in the 
pendant for 24 hours or until you use this property of 
the pendant again as a reaction or you choose to release 
it as a bonus action on your turn. A nonliving creature or 
creature without a soul, such as a construct or undead, 
is immune to this effect. While a soul is trapped in the 
pendant, you gain a +2 bonus to Wisdom ability checks 
and Wisdom saving throws while you’re wearing it.
In addition, you can use an action to telepathically ask 
the soul a question, as if by the 
speak with dead
 spell, 
regardless of what the form of its physical body was. 
Once a soul has been asked 3 questions in this way, it’s 
released from the pendant.
While a creature’s soul is trapped in the pendant, 
its body is under the effect of the 
gentle repose
 spell. 
If the creature is returned to life while you have its 
spirit trapped in this way, the spirit is released from the 
pendant and returned to its body.
"
Soul-Searing Scythe,"Weapon (halberd), legendary (requires attunement)
This brass weapon was forged in the heart of the 
Elemental Plane of Fire. You gain a +2 bonus to attack 
and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While 
holding the scythe, you can use a bonus action to speak 
its command word, causing soul-rending flames to erupt 
from the holes in the blade. These flames are harmless 
to you and shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim 
light for an additional 40 feet. The flames last until you 
use a bonus action to speak the command word again or 
until you drop or stow the scythe.
While the scythe is ablaze, it deals an extra 3d4 fire 
damage to any target it hits. This damage ignores fire re-
sistance and immunity, and it becomes necrotic damage 
when it hits a creature with the Fire Absorption trait.
In addition, when you score a critical hit with this 
weapon against a creature that is not a construct or 
undead, the target must make a DC 17 Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d4 
necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of your 
next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as 
much necrotic damage and isn’t stunned.
When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this 
weapon, its body and soul are immolated and destroyed 
unless it is a construct or undead. A creature whose 
body and soul have been destroyed by the 
soul-searing 
scythe
 can be restored to life only by a 
wish
 spell or 
divine intervention.
"
Sovereignseed Satchel,"Wondrous item, rare
This unassuming leather satchel is embroidered with a 
floral pattern and is connected to a strange garden on 
a special demiplane. The garden produces 4 magical 
seeds daily at dawn, which automatically appear at the 
bottom of the bag each day. When you open the bag to 
retrieve the seeds for the first time each day, roll 4d6 
and consult the table below to determine the nature 
of each seed. Any unused seeds turn to dust and are 
destroyed daily at dawn when the bag produces a new 
batch of seeds.
d6
Seed
1
Binding Bur.
 You can throw this jagged bur as if it 
were a dart or use it as a sling bullet. A Large or 
smaller creature hit by the bur must succeed on a 
DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by 
it for 1 minute, as the bur rapidly grows to form a 
series of entangling plants around it. A creature 
restrained in this way can use its action to make a 
DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself on a success. 
The bur withers and is destroyed once a creature 
succeeds on the saving throw or is no longer 
restrained by it.
2
Bouncing Bloom.
 You can use an action to plant 
this seed in the ground in an unoccupied space 
within your reach. When you do, a 5-foot-radius 
flower immediately grows in the space. A creature 
that jumps from the flower is propelled three 
times the normal distance, up to the creature’s 
remaining movement, without the need for a 
running start. The flower withers away and is 
destroyed after 10 minutes or after it’s been used 
to propel a creature in this way ten times.
3
Cloaking Cotton.
 You can use an action to hurl this 
boll into the air at a point within 5 feet of you. 
When you do, the boll erupts into an opaque cloud 
in a 20-foot-radius sphere, centered on that point. 
The sphere spreads around corners, and its area 
is heavily obscured. The sphere does not move 
with you. The cloud remains for 1 minute, until it’s 
dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed 
(at least 10 miles per hour), or until 5 or more fire 
damage is dealt to a target within the area.
d6
Seed
4
Fiddle-Ferry Fig.
 You can use an action to plant 
this seed in the ground or place it in a body of 
water in an unoccupied space within your reach. 
When you do, the seed immediately grows into 
a single, large leaf. A creature can break the leaf 
off its stem using an action. The leaf is 10 feet 
long and 5 feet across and can support up to 300 
pounds. Creatures standing or sitting on the leaf 
while it’s falling descend at a rate of 60 feet per 
round, or are supported by the leaf when floating 
in the water. If the leaf is carrying more than 300 
pounds, it immediately falls or sinks as normal. 
After 1 hour, the leaf and stem wither away and 
are destroyed.
5
Rose of Radiance.
 While held, this seed emits a 
warm glow, shedding bright light in a 30-foot 
radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. 
Alternatively, you can use an action to plant the 
seed in the ground at a point within your reach. 
When you do, a single, golden rose grows at the 
start of your next turn that sheds light twice as far 
as the seed. The effect lasts for 8 hours or until 
the flower is moved or destroyed.
6
Spanning Sprout.
 You can use an action to plant 
this seed in the ground in an unoccupied space 
within your reach. When you do, a bridge made of 
twisting vines grows horizontally in a line that’s 5 
feet wide and up to 30 feet long in a direction of 
your choice. The vines are sturdy and can support 
up to 500 pounds at a time, provided that both 
ends of the bridge connect to a solid surface, such 
as a point on the ground or a wall. The bridge 
withers away and is destroyed after 1 hour, or if it 
takes 15 slashing or fire damage (AC 10).
"
Spellfire Bow,"Weapon (longbow), legendary (requires attunement by a 
spellcaster)
This richly polished wooden longbow is ornamented 
with a silver trim and bowstring. Even if you aren’t at-
tuned to the bow, it creates a special arcane arrow when 
you draw it back without nocking one. When you fire the 
"
Spellsword,"Weapon (shortsword), rare
This item appears to be a shortsword hilt. While grasp-
ing the hilt, you can use a bonus action to expend a spell 
slot of 1st level or higher to activate the sword, causing a 
blade of pure energy to spring into existence. The sword 
remains activated for 8 hours, or until you deactivate 
it early using an action. Once you activate the sword in 
this way, you can use it as a spellcasting focus, and you 
are proficient with the 
spellsword
 for the duration.
You can use your spellcasting ability, instead of 
Strength or Dexterity, for your attack and damage rolls 
using this weapon, which deals force damage instead 
of piercing damage. If you activate the sword using a 
3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, its damage die becomes a 
d8, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with it. If you use a 5th-level slot or higher, its 
damage die becomes a d10, and the bonus increases to 
+2 instead.
When you deactivate the weapon early using an 
action, the remaining magic stored within the blade 
erupts into a wave of energy. Each creature in a 10-foot 
cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A 
creature takes 3d6 force damage on a failed save, or half 
as much damage on a successful one. If the sword was 
activated using a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, the force 
damage becomes 4d8, or 5d10 if it was activated with a 
5th-level slot or higher.
The blade emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and 
dim light for an additional 20 feet, and disappears if 
the sword is no longer activated or if you let go of the 
weapon. While holding the activated sword, you can use 
a bonus action to cause the blade to vanish or reappear.
"
Spellwriter’s Brace,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)
This writer’s hand brace allows you to prepare four 
extra spells from your spellbook whenever you finish a 
long rest. The spells can be no higher than 5th level and 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. When 
you do, the prepared spells appear on the skin of your 
arm as abstract spell tattoos that represent them. You 
can prepare the same spell multiple times in this way, 
taking the necessary time in order to do so, to create 
multiple copies of the same spell tattoo.
As an action, you can touch a willing creature and 
speak the brace’s command word to transfer one of your 
spell tattoos to it, causing the spell tattoo to disappear 
from your arm and appear on the creature instead. You 
can only have one tattoo transferred in this way at a 
time. Transferring a second spell tattoo causes the first 
one to disappear.
A spellcaster with a spell tattoo can expend a spell 
slot of the tattooed spell’s level or higher, using its spell 
save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability to 
do so. Once the spell is cast, its tattoo disappears.
Any spell tattoos created by the brace disappear when 
you finish a long rest or remove the brace.
"
Spirit Cleaver,"Weapon (dagger), legendary (requires attunement by a 
rogue)
This dark metal blade can slip between a person and 
their spirit to sever their connection to one another. 
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon, which deals slashing damage 
instead of piercing damage.
While holding this weapon, you can use an action to 
cast the 
etherealness
 spell from it with the following 
changes:
 
y
 While on the Ethereal Plane, you can attack targets 
that you can see on the plane you originated from 
with the 
spirit cleaver
. These attacks are made with 
advantage. If a target has 75 hit points or fewer 
after taking Sneak Attack damage in this way and 
isn’t a construct or undead, it must succeed on a DC 
17 Constitution saving throw or die.
 
y
 The spell has a duration of 1 minute, but ends early 
if you attack a creature on the plane you originated 
from with the 
spirit cleaver
.
Once this property of the weapon has been used, it 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
My magic runs as deep in me as the 
scars it leaves behind.
"
Spirit Sheath,"Weapon (scimitar), rare (requires attunement by a creature 
with a Wisdom score of 13 or higher)
This scimitar and its sheath are bound by a spiritual 
force that resonates with you when you attune to it. The 
sheath collects and incubates spiritual energy before 
it’s focused and radiated by its blade. You gain a +1 
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic 
weapon, and you are proficient with this scimitar while 
you’re attuned to it. When you make an attack with this 
weapon, you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of 
Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. 
You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
While holding the sword, you can use a bonus action 
to cast the 
spiritual weapon
 spell from it (spell attack 
bonus +7, +4 spellcasting ability modifier), creating a 
spiritual duplicate of the scimitar in the air within range. 
Once this property of the scimitar has been used, it can’t 
be used again until the next dawn.
"
Spiritwalker Breastplate,"Armor (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)
When you drop to 0 hit points while wearing this armor, 
your spirit leaves your body and appears as a floating, 
ghostly version of yourself. The spirit remains there for 
1 minute or until you regain consciousness, at which 
point the spirit returns to your body. For the duration, 
you don’t suffer a death saving throw failure as a result 
of taking damage, and you can only die from damage if 
the total damage you take on a turn equals or exceeds 
your hit point maximum. You still make death saving 
throws at the start of each of your turns while in this 
state; however, the number you must roll to succeed on a 
death saving throw increases by 1 for every 5 feet away 
from your physical body your spirit is at the start of each 
of your turns.
Your spirit is tethered to your physical body and 
can’t be farther than 30 feet away from it at any time. 
The spirit has your senses, a flying speed of 30 feet, 
and can hover. On your turn, it can only move and take 
the Help action. The spirit is immune to all damage 
and is incorporeal, but an effect that turns undead will 
automatically send your spirit back to your physical body 
and end the effect early.
Once this property has been used, it can’t be used 
again until the next dawn.
"
Splinterguard,"Armor (splint), rare (requires attunement by a druid or 
ranger)
The protective panels that adorn this splint armor are 
made from carefully molded pieces of ironleaf lumber, 
a wood renowned for its remarkable durability. Even if 
you aren’t attuned to the armor, you gain the following 
benefits:
While you’re wearing this armor, any critical hit 
against you becomes a normal hit. In addition, the 
first time each day you’re struck by a critical hit, the 
armor’s panels splinter into countless shards of painful, 
wooden shrapnel. Other creatures within 10 feet of 
you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
3d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. Once this happens, the 
armor’s wooden panels are cracked until the following 
dawn, at which point they magically regrow. Until the 
panels regrow, the armor can’t be splintered again and 
suffers a –2 penalty to the AC it offers. The panels can’t 
be repaired by magical or mundane means, but a 
plant 
growth
 spell can cause the panels to regrow early once 
before each dawn.
If you’re attuned to this armor, you’re considered 
proficient with it, and you don’t suffer disadvantage 
on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make as a result of 
wearing it. In addition, creatures hit by the armor’s 
shrapnel when it splinters take 5d8 piercing damage, 
instead of 3d8, and you can choose which creatures in 
the area are affected by it when it happens.
"
Sream’s Stoppered Oasis,"Potion, rare
This tall decanter is filled with water from a miraculous 
oasis in the H’rethi Desert and is stoppered with a 
small, overgrown planter. You can pour the water out 
of the bottle on top of the planter as an action to create 
a magical oasis that fills up to a 100-foot-square space 
over the course of 10 minutes.
The oasis has a pond filled with clean water and 
exotic, fruit-bearing trees that can nourish up to fifteen 
"
Staff of Cubic Cultivation,"Staff, uncommon
This staff has a perfect cube of blue crystal at its top 
that slowly drips with a viscous ooze. The staff has 10 
charges. As an action, you can tap the head of the staff 
on the ground and expend 1 or more of its charges to 
create a 5-foot cube of a mysterious, gelatinous material 
for each expended charge. Each cube appears in an 
unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or adjacent to 
another cube you create as part of this action. The 
cubes are translucent objects that have AC 10, 20 hit 
points, and resistance to acid damage. Creating a cube 
in a space smaller than 5 feet across causes the cube 
to squeeze and fit the space. A cube remains for 1 
minute or until it’s reduced to 0 hit points, after which it 
dissolves into a puddle of slime and vanishes.
You can climb or walk on the cubes. However, their 
sticky surfaces are considered difficult terrain.
The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, 
the gem on top of the staff shatters and is destroyed, 
creating a gelatinous cube in its place that’s hostile 
toward you. When this happens, the staff becomes a 
nonmagical quarterstaff.
"
Staff of the Dream Shepherd,"Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This staff’s cushioned handle is lined with soft wool 
and decorated with star and moon patches. While the 
staff is within 5 feet of you, you can use an action to 
immediately fall asleep, but otherwise can’t be put to 
sleep by magical means. While attuned to the staff, you 
regain 1 extra Hit Die whenever you finish a long rest.
In addition, while holding the staff, you can use an ac-
tion to summon a flock of spectral sheep. The sheep run 
in a line 20 feet long and 10 feet wide originating from 
you before disappearing. Each creature of your choice 
in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw against 
your spell save DC, taking 2d6 psychic damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
If a creature fails the saving throw and has 20 hit points 
or fewer after taking this damage, it also falls asleep. 
Undead and creatures immune to being charmed can’t 
be put to sleep in this way. A sleeping creature is uncon-
scious and stays asleep for 1 minute, until it takes dam-
age, or until someone uses an action to shake or slap the 
creature awake. Once this property of the staff has been 
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Staff of the Vineyard,"Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, 
monk, or ranger)
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. A 
clutch of up to 10 grapes hangs from the end of the 
staff’s magical length of vine. A creature within reach 
of the staff can use an action to eat one of the grapes, 
which duplicates the effect of eating a berry from the 
goodberry
 spell. 1d10 eaten grapes regrow on the clutch 
daily at dawn.
While holding the staff, you can use an action to cast 
the 
entangle
 spell from it (save DC 13), causing twisting 
grapevines to sprout from the ground in the target area. 
If a creature restrained by these vines makes a Strength 
check to free itself and fails, that creature becomes 
magically drunk until the end of its next turn. A drunk 
creature is poisoned for the duration. Once this property 
of the staff has been used, it can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
"
Stalagmight Geode,"Weapon (greatclub), rare
This snapped-off rock formation has a cache of magical, 
growing crystals inside it. You gain a +1 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 
When you hit a creature with this weapon and roll the 
maximum number possible on the weapon’s damage 
die, the crystals rapidly grow and increase the weapon’s 
damage die by one size, up to a d12. For example, when 
you roll an 8 on the weapon’s normal d8 damage die, its 
damage die magically becomes a d10 after the attack. 
Immediately after you roll a 12 on a d12 damage die 
in this way, each creature within 5 feet of the greatclub 
(other than yourself) must make a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw. A creature takes 1d12 piercing damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one, as the weapon’s crystals explode into shrapnel. 
Once the crystal explodes, the weapon’s damage die 
becomes a d8 again.
"
Stalwart Staff,"Staff, common
A carved walking stick with a handle wrapped in worn 
leather, this magic staff gives you better endurance. 
While you use this staff as a walking stick while 
traveling on foot, you have advantage on the first save 
you make to endure a forced march.
"
Starmetal Nova Armor,"Armor (chain shirt and half plate), legendary (requires 
attunement)
This magic set of iron armor is forged from metals 
that fell from the sky. The armor has two parts that 
can be worn together simultaneously: a chain shirt and 
a set of half plate armor. You have a +2 bonus to AC 
and resistance to lightning damage while wearing this 
armor. While wearing the chain shirt, you can speak the 
armor’s command word as an action to don or doff the 
starmetal nova armor’s
 half plate, causing it to either 
magically assemble itself around you or release and fall 
to the ground at your feet. You must be within 30 feet 
of the half plate in order to don the armor in this way. 
In addition, you always know which way is north while 
attuned to the armor.
Polarity Repulsion.
 While wearing either part of this 
armor, when a creature that you can see that’s holding 
or wearing a metal object (such as a metal weapon or 
suit of heavy or medium metal armor) moves within 10 
feet of you for the first time on its turn, you can use your 
reaction to change the polarity of your armor’s metal 
and repel yourself up to 10 feet away from that creature, 
without provoking opportunity attacks.
Supernova Burst.
 While wearing both the chain shirt 
and half plate parts of the armor, you can use an action 
to speak the armor’s other command word to doff the 
half plate and cause it to explode from you, releasing a 
30-foot-radius burst of bright light. When you do, you 
end any grapple condition on yourself and force all 
creatures other than you within the bright light that are 
not behind total cover to make a DC 17 Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 
"
Starmetal Shard Spear,"Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement)
This weapon’s otherwise small blade is made larger by 
3 sharp fragments of starmetal that remain magically 
connected to it. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever 
you hit a creature with an attack using the head of 
this spear, you can choose to leave 1 of the fragments 
embedded in its body. As a bonus action, you can speak 
the spear’s command word to cause all embedded 
shards to magically return to the blade of the spear, 
flying through the air and avoiding creatures and objects 
to do so. When you do, the target takes 1d6 slashing 
damage for each embedded shard as it leaves the body. 
If all 3 shards are embedded in the same creature when 
you speak the command word, the creature’s speed is 
also halved until the end of your next turn. If the spear 
is ever more than 120 feet away from a shard, the shard 
magically returns to the spear without harming the 
creature it was embedded in.
Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the 
spear, the weapon flies back to your hand.
"
Starmetal Sliver,"Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement)
This slim blade was forged using strange, unearthly 
metals from a meteorite. When you use an action to 
toss this magic dagger into the air, it orbits your body 
at a distance of 1d3 feet. Another creature can use an 
action to grasp the dagger to separate it from you, either 
by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or 
a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You 
can use an action to seize and either wield or stow the 
dagger.
When you take the Attack action while the dagger 
is orbiting you, you can use a bonus action to cause 
the dagger to attack a target within 10 feet of you. The 
dagger uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to 
damage rolls. Immediately after the attack, the dagger 
returns to orbit you.
In addition, the dagger creates a small gravitational 
field that wards off harm. While the dagger orbits you, 
when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, the damage 
you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + 4. If the 
damage is reduced to 0, the missile slows to a stop 
without hitting you and falls to the ground at your feet.
"
Status Signets,"Ring, common
These silver rings often come in pairs and indicate the 
well-being of its wearer. If you and another friendly 
creature you can see are wearing these rings within 100 
feet of each other, you are magically aware of the other 
creature’s current number of hit points and condition.
"
Steam Harpoon,"Weapon (spear), rare
A curious mesh of magic and steam-powered 
mechanism, this spear’s barbed head can be launched 
from its shaft and quickly retrieved using the attached 
chain. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. Once on each of your 
turns when you attack with the spear, you can choose 
to make a special ranged attack with it, firing the spear 
head toward a target within 20 feet of you. This ranged 
attack uses your Dexterity modifier for its attack and 
damage rolls. On a hit, the target must succeed on a 
DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 
feet toward you. A Huge or larger target automatically 
succeeds on the saving throw. Hit or miss, the spear’s 
head then reels back and reattaches to the top of the 
weapon immediately after the attack.
"
Stonemason’s Companion,"Wondrous item, uncommon
These tools were crafted by a lonely stonemason with 
a desire for a companion. You gain a +1 bonus to ability 
checks made using this set of mason’s tools.
If you are proficient with mason’s tools, you can use 
these tools to carve 10 gp worth of fine stone into the 
shape of a Small or smaller creature over the course 
of a full workday, mimicking the effects of the 
find 
familiar
 spell with the following changes: the familiar 
is an elemental and, while it remains motionless, it is 
indistinguishable from a stone statue.
When the familiar falls to 0 hit points, the spell ends 
and it crumbles into a pile of nonmagical rubble. While a 
familiar created by the stonemason’s companion exists, 
you can’t use the tools to create another one.
"
Storm Seer Lamp,"Wondrous item, common
This crystal lantern gives off a faint, refreshing smell 
that reminds you of being near the ocean. As a bonus 
action, you can touch the crystal to cause it to glow, 
casting bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light 
for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen 
radius. You can alter the radius or cause the light to fade 
using a bonus action to touch the crystal again. Once the 
lamp has glowed for a total of 8 hours, it can’t be used 
again in this way until the next dusk.
In addition, the lamp can detect incoming storms up 
to 3 hours before they arrive. If an approaching storm 
would affect the area within 1 mile of the lamp, the 
crystal’s light becomes an eerie, cold gray.
"
Storm’s Eye Shield,"Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)
Emblazoned on the face of this round shield is a cyclone 
design that magically swirls based on the likelihood 
and proximity of thunderstorms. While holding this 
shield, you have resistance to lightning damage. When 
you take lightning damage from a hostile source while 
holding this shield, you can use your reaction to cast the 
thunderwave
 spell (save DC 15) from it. This property 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
In addition, while the shield is flat on the ground, you 
can perform a 1 minute ritual to cast the 
augury
 spell 
from it. When you do, the omens are represented by how 
the cyclone’s design changes:
 
y
 Calm clouds,
 for good results
 
y
 Roiling clouds,
 for bad results
 
y
 A flash of lightning,
 for both good and bad results
 
y
 Nothing,
 for results that aren’t especially good or 
bad
Once this property of the shield has been used, it can’t 
be used again until it’s been in the presence of another 
thunderstorm for at least 1 hour.
"
Stormbrewer Bracers,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This pair of electrum bracers are always covered in a 
thin layer of condensation. When you roll initiative while 
wearing the bracers, they begin to billow out wafting 
clouds around your wrists. The clouds surrounding your 
wrists grow darker with every charge the bracers have, 
becoming fierce storm clouds when fully charged. The 
bracers can hold up to 5 charges, which are lost after 1 
"
Storyteller’s Stein,"Wondrous item, common
These steins are enchanted with a clever version of the 
prestidigitation
 spell that reacts when in the company 
of a good story. Whenever you tell a story while holding 
this stein, its lid opens and closes like a mouth to 
emit sounds and other harmless sensory effects that 
accompany the tale. For example, if you’re telling the 
story of a thunderstorm at sea, the stein can create the 
sounds of rumbling thunder and creaking floorboards, 
or allow you to spew illusory flames after taking a drink 
from the stein when you tell the story of an ancient red 
dragon’s deadly breath.
"
Stuffy Familiar,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This small stuffed animal is soft to the touch and perfect 
for hugging. If you can cast the 
find familiar
 spell, you 
can use the animal as the material component for the 
spell, without it being consumed. When you do, the 
familiar inhabits the form of the stuffed animal, whose 
appearance you can change as part of casting the spell 
in this way. The familiar is a construct, in addition to 
being either a celestial, fey, or fiend, but its statistics 
are otherwise unchanged from its normal form. The 
familiar’s stuffed animal form must be appropriate to 
the statistics of its normal animal one. For example, a 
familiar within a griffon stuffed animal could use the 
statistics for a cat or hawk, but not a poisonous snake. 
The stuffed animal grows or shrinks to match the size of 
the familiar’s normal form.
While the familiar remains motionless, it is 
indistinguishable from a normal stuffed animal. If you 
temporarily dismiss the familiar, the stuffed animal and 
familiar disappear into a pocket dimension together. If 
the familiar is dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, 
it leaves the stuffed animal behind.
"
Stylist’s Circlet,"Wondrous item, common
While wearing this leather circlet, you can use a bonus 
action to change your hair’s length, color, and styling. 
When you remove the circlet, your hair returns to its 
natural appearance. Your hair can grow up to 5 feet 
long in this way, and any hair you cut off immediately 
vanishes.
"
Tarrasque Plate,"Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)
This impenetrable armor is made from refined 
fragments of a tarrasque’s armored hide and retains 
some of its original properties. You have resistance to 
damage from spells and a +1 bonus to AC while wearing 
this armor. In addition, whenever you’re targeted by a 
magic missile
 spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires 
a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 6, you are unaffected 
by the spell, and the effect is reflected back at the caster 
as though it originated from you, turning the caster into 
the target.
"
Tea Weird,"Wondrous item, common
This Tiny, sentient fragment of a charmed water 
elemental has an endless desire to create tea. When 
given a leaf or other potential tea ingredient, its watery 
form gurgles happily as it begins to steep it, magically 
heating the water surrounding the ingredient to its 
ideal brewing temperature. It only picks up materials it 
chooses to and can control whether or not it’s wet to the 
touch. The 
tea weird
 can inhabit up to 1 gallon of water, 
or as little as 1 ounce. Any water controlled by the 
tea 
weird
 is magical for the duration.
The 
tea weird
 is considered a magical object and is 
not a creature. It has a speed of 5 feet and can hover up 
to 5 feet off the ground. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and 
has resistance to all damage. The 
tea weird
 regains all 
its hit points if given at least 1 ounce of water. Drinking 
the entire 
tea weird
 is harmless to you, but destroys the 
item.
Sentience.
 The 
tea weird
 is a sentient chaotic good 
item with an Intelligence of 3, a Wisdom of 8, and a 
Charisma of 6. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 60 feet. It can’t speak or read, but understands 
Aquan and Common.
Personality.
 The 
tea weird
 is dedicated to making 
tea. It will happily collect moisture, steep it with fresh 
ingredients, and then separate itself from the freshly 
brewed tea by pouring it into a cup or similar vessel. It 
avoids combat at all costs and enjoys resting in cups, 
kettles, or the pockets of friendly creatures.
"
Tempest Griffon Bracers,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
While wearing these oiled bracers lined with magic 
griffon feathers, your speed increases by 5 feet.  
In addition, you can use an action to speak the 
bracers’ command word to vanish into a plume of sparks 
and feathers. Choose up to 3 different creatures that 
you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a melee weapon 
attack against each target, briefly appearing next to 
each one before making the attack. A target takes an 
extra 2d8 lightning damage on a hit, or half as much 
lightning damage on a miss. You can then teleport to an 
unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of 
the targets or return to your original space, reappearing 
in a flourish of electricity, feathers, and wind. Once this 
property of the bracers has been used, it can’t be used 
again until the next dawn.
"
Thalamus Thread,"Wondrous item, rare
This pale gray thread is made from the remains of 
a powerful mystic’s brain. The overdeveloped organ 
creates a congealed fiber that, once spun, can be used 
as a functional bowstring. It’s always oily to the touch 
and leaves a faint residue on your fingers when pulled. 
Ranged attacks made with a weapon strung with this 
thread are considered magical.
When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using a 
bow or crossbow that was strung with this thread, you 
can speak the thread’s command word as part of the 
attack to charge the arrow or bolt with psychic power. 
When you do, the target of the attack takes an extra 1d8 
psychic damage and must make a DC 15 Intelligence 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is stunned 
until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, 
the creature is not stunned. A construct or undead 
creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw. 
This property of the thread can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
"
Thomas’s Dimensional Trousers,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This flashy set of pants has four pockets that each lead 
to a special, extradimensional space. Each pocket is six 
inches wide at the mouth and can hold up to 20 pounds 
of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. 
The pants always weigh 1 pound, regardless of their 
contents.
Placing an object in one of the pants’ pockets follows 
the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving 
an item from the pants requires an action as your hand 
rummages around inside for a few moments before 
finding the item it’s looking for.
If the pants are overloaded, pierced, or torn, they 
rupture and tear, scattering their contents in a 300-foot 
radius around you. Casting the 
mending
 spell on the 
pants daily for 30 days restores the pants’ connection to 
the extradimensional spaces. If one or more pockets are 
turned inside out, their contents spill forth, unharmed, 
but the pocket must be put right before it can be used 
again. Breathing creatures inside the pocket can survive 
up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the 
number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which 
time they begin to suffocate.
Placing the pants inside an extradimensional space 
created by a 
bag of holding
, 
portable hole
, or similar 
item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to 
the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item 
was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet 
of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on 
the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-
way only and can’t be reopened.
"
Tide Turner,"Wondrous item, common
This magical brass timepiece has a pearl from the Lunar 
Sea at its top and tells you the phase of the moon, time 
between dawn and dusk, and time between high and 
low tides while on the Material Plane. Other planes may 
cause the device’s various dials to behave differently. For 
example, on the Elemental Plane of Water, the tide’s dial 
may spin chaotically, whereas the daytime dial may only 
move based on your location while on the home plane of 
fey creatures.
"
Titan Cricket Greaves,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
These unusual leg braces are crafted from the legs of 
a giant cricket. While wearing the braces, your long 
jump is up to 25 feet and your high jump is up to 15 
feet, unless it’s already higher, with or without a running 
start. Further, your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
In addition, you can use an action to rub your 
legs together while wearing the braces to create the 
signature sound of one or many crickets. The sound can 
be as quiet as a whisper or as loud as a scream.
"
Titan’s Tooth Claymore,"Weapon (greatsword), very rare
This massive two-handed blade is made from the lost or 
harvested tooth of a tarrasque. You gain a +2 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 
If it hits an object, the hit is automatically a critical hit. 
In addition, if you roll a 20 on an attack roll using this 
weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage.
Fragments of the titan’s reddish carapace lay scattered 
across the scarred remains of the town. It was the only 
visible damage done to the monster even after hours of battle 
and countless lives lost. In the end, the survivors were only 
left because the beast had had its fill.
Through the wreckages, the young blacksmith, Voja, 
collected the jagged pieces of red shell. She worked tirelessly 
at the forge for weeks. Then months. A year. Trying to break 
what broke her and remake it in her vision. She quenched 
the fires of her rage and grief with sweat and tears, focusing 
only on the work laid out in front of her.
It was only then, after a year of relentless toil, that the 
monster’s shell finally became pliable to her. Eventually, the 
armor that once shielded her home’s destroyer would become 
the armor that protected her on her path of vengeance.
"
Tome of Advanced Fighting Styles,"Wondrous item, very rare
This book’s magically charged pages are filled with 
detailed descriptions and illustrations that teach unique 
styles of combat. If you spend 48 hours over a period 
of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and 
practicing its guidelines, you gain one of the following 
Advanced Fighting Styles:
Advanced Simplicity.
 Your attacks made with simple 
weapons score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
Crushing Blows.
 When you score a critical hit using 
a melee weapon that has the heavy property, the target 
takes extra bludgeoning damage equal to 5 + the ability 
score modifier you used for your attack and damage 
rolls.
Net Mastery.
 When you throw a net, its normal and 
long range is doubled. In addition, the first time that a 
creature attempts to escape from a net that you threw, 
the escape DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice), unless 
it’s already higher.
Quick Shot.
 You gain a special reach with ranged 
weapons called a firing reach that’s a number of feet 
equal to 5 + your normal reach. While you are wielding a 
ranged weapon, other creatures provoke an opportunity 
attack from you when they move out of your firing reach.
Readied Bulwark.
 You gain a +2 bonus to AC against 
opportunity attacks while holding a shield.
Versatile Expert.
 When you hit with an attack using a 
weapon that has the versatile property, you can use the 
two-handed damage die even if you’re only wielding the 
weapon with one hand.
You can’t take an Advanced Fighting Style option more 
than once, even if you later get to choose again. Once 
the book has been used to grant an Advanced Fighting 
Style, it loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
"
Tome of Lost Knowledge,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a 
wizard)
This gold-trimmed book’s cover is embossed with 
a portrait of 
Ogden Fellweaver
 (see appendix L), a 
legendary wizard infamous for his ill-gotten knowledge. 
If you can attune to this item, you can use it as a 
spellbook and an arcane focus. If your attunement to the 
book ends, anything written in the book disappears.
Absorb Knowledge.
 Immediately after a creature 
that you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell of 
1st level or higher, you can use your reaction to make 
an Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC equals 10 + the 
spell’s level. On a success, the spell is magically added 
to the book in your own notation. You must be holding 
the book to use this property. If the added spell is a 
wizard spell and of a level for which you have spell slots, 
you can prepare this spell just like your other spells. If 
the spell is not a wizard spell, its notation is garbled and 
impossible to use. Once this property has been used, it 
can’t be used again until a number of days equal to the 
spell’s level have passed.
Shift Knowledge.
 While using this book as your 
spellbook, you can replace up to 3 spells from your 
prepared list of spells when you finish a short rest. Once 
this property has been used, it can’t be used again until 
the next dawn.
Unknown Knowledge.
 While holding the book, you 
can use an action to channel its hidden knowledge. 
When you do, you gain proficiency in one skill or tool 
of your choice until the next dawn. If you’re already 
proficient in the chosen skill or tool, your proficiency 
bonus is instead doubled for any ability check you make 
using that skill or tool. Once this property has been 
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Curse.
 This book is cursed, and becoming attuned 
to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain 
cursed, you are unwilling to part with the book, 
keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you are 
compelled to use this book as your spellbook. Each time 
you prepare a spell from another spellbook, you take 
psychic damage equal to the spell’s level.
"
Torrdok’s Magnificent Forgery,"Wondrous item, rare
This large, gilded mirror is 5 feet tall, 3 feet across, and 
weighs 20 pounds. While the mirror is against a wall or 
similar vertical surface, you can speak its first command 
word using an action to magically fasten the mirror to 
the wall. You can unfasten the mirror by speaking the 
command word again using another action.
While the mirror is fastened to a wall, its reflective 
surface becomes oily and moves ever so slightly. If the 
fastened mirror is facing a room that’s no larger than 
40 feet on a side for 24 hours, the reflection stiffens and 
becomes a beautiful painting of the room’s reflection. 
The painting remains until the mirror is removed from 
the wall. While the painting remains, a creature can use 
an action to touch its surface and speak the mirror’s 
second command word to be magically transported to 
a special demiplane identical to the room the mirror is 
facing, including any of its furniture and decorations. 
Doing so again from within the demiplane transports 
you back to the nearest unoccupied space to the mirror 
in the original room. Any furniture or decoration created 
by the demiplane can’t be removed from it, and if a 
piece of furniture or decoration was magical in the 
original room, the copy of it is not. Further, any doors or 
windows found in the original room don’t appear in the 
demiplane’s version.
Anything brought into the demiplane is shunted 
back to the original room when the mirror is 
removed from the wall. While the painting remains, 
it is indistinguishable from a regular painting. A 
successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence 
(Investigation) check can reveal the true nature of the 
painting, but not what command words are required to 
use it.
"
Traitor’s Gauntlet,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This pair of gloves is matched with one dark metal 
gauntlet, which once belonged to a traitorous knight 
who was burned for his treason. While wearing these 
gloves and gauntlet, your unarmed strikes with your 
hands are turned into magic weapons that deal 1d8 
necrotic damage.
In addition, you can use a bonus action to speak the 
gauntlet’s command word while holding a nonmagical 
melee weapon in the hand that’s wearing it. When you 
do, the weapon becomes magical while you hold it in 
that hand. The weapon ceases to be magical if you 
throw, drop, or stow it. While the weapon is magical 
in this way, it’s wreathed in dark flames that cause any 
target hit by it to take necrotic damage, instead of the 
weapon’s normal damage, as well as an extra 1d8 fire 
damage.
While unworn, the gauntlet can be magically altered 
to fit over either hand by speaking its other command 
word as an action.
Curse.
 This gauntlet is cursed, and becoming attuned 
to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain 
cursed, you are unwilling to part with the gauntlet, keep-
ing it within reach at all times, and you can’t remove the 
gloves. In addition, while you’re cursed, you gain the 
following flaw: “Everyone has an ulterior motive, so I 
can only count on myself.” While you have this flaw, you 
have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma 
(Persuasion) checks made to interact with friendly crea-
tures, and you can’t take the Help action.
"
Trampling Crossbow,"Weapon (crossbow, heavy), uncommon
This heavy crossbow carries with it the force of a raging 
bull. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with 
this magic weapon, the bolt transforms into a spectral 
stampede immediately after it hits the target. When it 
does, the target and up to 2 other targets of your choice 
that you can see within 15 feet of it must make a DC 13 
Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 
1d8 bludgeoning damage, and if it is Large or smaller, 
it’s pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful 
save, a target takes half as much bludgeoning damage 
and isn’t pushed. This bludgeoning damage is doubled 
against objects and structures.
"
Tremor Spike,"Rod, rare
This industrial, hollow rod is 3 feet long and weighs 15 
pounds. The rod has a tapered spike on one end and 
an open, tower-like chimney on the other. Three hinged 
legs unfold from the sides of the rod, allowing it to stand 
upright with its spiked end pointed downward. Standing 
or collapsing the rod in this way requires an action.
The unfolded legs magically fasten the rod to the 
ground while it’s standing, but a creature can use its 
action to try to push it over with a successful DC 20 
Strength check. Once the rod is no longer standing, it 
magically deactivates and collapses itself again.
As a bonus action, you can press a button on the 
standing rod to cause its mechanisms to churn and 
whir, repeatedly sending its spike into the ground below 
it. Pressing the button again deactivates the rod. The 
spike sends out loud, drum-like shockwaves every 6 
seconds. The waves are audible out to 300 feet, or 1200 
feet if a creature has tremorsense. If a creature has 
tremorsense, its range is halved while it’s within 300 
feet of the active rod. A creature can’t perceive anything 
within 30 feet of the active rod using its tremorsense, 
but is aware that the disrupting shockwaves originate 
from that location.
"
Turtle Brooch,"Wondrous item, common
This gold and amber brooch resembles a turtle that’s 
been flipped on its back. While you’re wearing it, 
standing up from being prone costs 5 feet less of your 
movement (to a minimum of 5 feet).
"
Tyrannosaurus Rax,"Weapon (greataxe), rare (requires attunement)
This bone-carved axe can channel the might of a 
rampaging tyrannosaurus rex. You gain a +1 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 
While holding the axe, you can use a bonus action to 
rampage. While rampaging, you can move through the 
space of any creature of your size or smaller. When 
you move through a creature’s space in this way while 
rampaging, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity 
attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn. Once 
on each of your turns while rampaging, you can force 
a creature whose space you move through in this way 
to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw 
(its choice). On a failed save, that creature takes 1d6 
bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. In addition, 
while you’re rampaging, your weapon attacks with this 
weapon score a critical hit against objects, structures, 
and prone creatures on a roll of 19 or 20.
Your rampage lasts for up to 1 minute. It ends early 
if you don’t move through a hostile creature’s space on 
your turn or if you drop to 0 hit points. This property of 
the axe can be used twice and regains all expended uses 
daily at dawn.
"
Underworld Asphodel Regalia,"Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric 
or wizard)
This set of royal finery was worn by a noble 
necromancer with a unique appreciation for the quality 
of life that extends beyond death. Asphodel blossoms, 
representing life beyond the tomb, ornament this 
enchanted outfit. The lush flowers in its laurel crown are 
nestled among long-dead leaves.
While wearing the regalia, you can cast the 
animate 
dead
 spell from it over the course of 1 minute. You 
can use this property a number of times equal to your 
spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain all expended 
uses daily at dusk. When you create an undead using 
a necromancy spell, the creature’s hit point maximum 
is increased by an amount equal to five times your 
spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, when you cast 
a spell that deals necrotic damage, you can add your 
spellcasting ability modifier to one damage roll of that 
spell.
Chthonic Command.
 As an action, you can issue a 
command of either dismissal or obedience to an undead 
creature within 60 feet of you. That creature must 
make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save 
DC. A creature immune to features that turn undead 
automatically succeeds on the saving throw. On a failed 
save, you can impose one of the following effects on that 
creature for 1 minute:
 
y
 The creature must spend its turns trying to move 
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly 
move into a space within 30 feet of you. It also 
can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only 
the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that 
prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can 
move, the creature can use the Dodge action. This 
effect ends early if that creature takes any damage.
 
y
 The creature is charmed by you. While the creature 
is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as 
long as the two of you are on the same plane of 
existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue 
commands to the creature while you are conscious 
(no action required), which it does its best to 
obey. You can specify a simple and general course 
of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run 
over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature 
completes the order and doesn’t receive further 
direction from you, it defends and preserves itself 
to the best of its ability. Each time the creature 
takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw 
against your spell save DC. If the saving throw 
succeeds, the effect ends.
You can use this property a number of times equal 
to your spellcasting ability modifier. You regain all 
expended uses daily at dusk.
Ruler of the Dead.
 You are always under the effects 
of the 
sanctuary
 spell. This version of the spell only 
affects undead. If you make an attack or cast a spell that 
affects an undead creature, that creature is immune to 
this spell’s effects for 24 hours.
"
Urnblade,"Weapon (scimitar), rare (requires attunement)
This item appears to be a small cremation urn. While 
grasping the urn, you can use a bonus action to speak its 
first command word and cause its lid to unseal. When 
you do, a curved blade of dark smoke pours from the 
mouth of the urn. Speaking the command word again 
reseals the urn and causes the blade to disappear. If you 
are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are 
proficient with the 
urnblade
.
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon, which deals necrotic damage 
instead of slashing damage.
Shadow Ally.
 While holding the urn, you can use an 
action to speak its second command word to animate 
your body’s shadow, transforming it into an undead 
creature. When you do, your body’s shadow detaches 
from you and becomes a shadow in an unoccupied space 
that you can see within 10 feet of you.
On your turn, you can mentally command the shadow 
if you aren’t incapacitated. You decide what action the 
shadow takes and where it moves during its next turn, 
or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack 
your enemies or guard a location. The GM has the 
shadow’s statistics. This shadow doesn’t cause a new 
one to appear when a non-evil humanoid dies from its 
attacks.
The 
urnblade’s
 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
becomes +2 while the summoned shadow exists. In 
addition, if you are the target of an attack and are 
within 5 feet of the shadow, you can use your reaction 
to command your shadow to become the target of the 
attack instead.
The shadow disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, 
when it’s farther than 120 feet from you, or when you 
use an action to dismiss it. When it disappears, your 
cast shadow returns. If the shadow drops to 0 hit points, 
there is a cumulative 5 percent chance that the urn 
turns to dust and is destroyed.
"
Vain Virtuoso’s Violin,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)
This finely crafted instrument is inlaid with intricate 
pearl designs. When you give another creature a Bardic 
Inspiration die using this violin, you also gain one 
yourself, which is a d4.
Curse.
 This violin is cursed, and becoming attuned 
to it extends the curse to you. When a creature that 
you can see (including yourself) fails an ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw after adding the bonus 
from your Bardic Inspiration to the total of the roll, you 
take psychic damage equal to the number rolled on the 
Bardic Inspiration die as you lose faith in your own 
abilities. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
"
Verax Weapon,"Weapon (any metal melee weapon), rare
A 
verax weapon
 has been made by quenching its metal 
in the blood of a particular creature while being forged, 
enchanting the weapon with a magic that hunts down 
creatures of the chosen type. You gain a +1 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
Use the table below to choose or randomly determine 
what creature type’s blood was used to enchant the 
weapon. When you use this weapon to attack a creature 
of the chosen type and are forced to make the attack roll 
with disadvantage, you make the attack roll as normal 
instead.

"
Violet King’s Promise,"Weapon (rapier), legendary (requires attunement by a bard, 
cleric, paladin, or ranger)
This elegant brass rapier was originally wielded by a 
beloved king, whose empathy and care for his subjects 
lives on within the blade. When you hit with an attack 
using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d8 
fire damage. In addition, you can use this rapier as a 
spellcasting focus.
The rapier has 7 charges and regains all expended 
charges daily at dawn. While holding it, a number of 
gems inside the guard equal to the weapon’s remaining 
charges glow red. When you expend a charge from the 
rapier, it releases a plume of dark smoke from one of the 
gems.
If an attacker makes a spell attack against you or 
a target within 5 feet of you while you’re holding the 
rapier, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage 
on the attack roll. If the attack misses and was a spell 
of 1st level or higher, the rapier regains 1 expended 
charge.
While holding the rapier, you can expend 1 or more 
of its charges to give one of three decrees that affect the 
flow of magic and battle:
“Clemency.”
 When you cast a spell of 1st level or 
higher that restores hit points to a single creature, you 
can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to cause a 
different creature within 10 feet of the original target 
to regain 1d8 hit points per spell level. When you do, 
each creature has advantage on the next ability check or 
saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.
“Condemn.”
 When you cast a spell that deals damage 
to a single creature, you can use your reaction to expend 
2 charges to cause that target as well as a different 
creature within 10 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving 
throw using your spell save DC. On a failed save, a 
creature takes 3d8 fire damage and has disadvantage on 
the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next 
turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much 
fire damage and makes its next attack roll as normal.
“Overrule.”
 After you roll dice to restore hit points 
to a single creature or roll damage for a spell attack 
or attack using this weapon, you can expend up to 2 
charges (no action required) to change the result of 
those dice. For each charge you spend, you can use the 
highest number possible for two of those dice instead of 
the numbers you rolled.
Flaw.
 The 
Violet King’s promise
 makes its wielder 
empathic and reluctant to resort to violence. While 
attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: “I 
am slow to resort to violence, even if it’s at the cost of 
my own safety.” In addition, if you are attuned to the 
weapon for 24 consecutive hours, your soft-heartedness 
causes you to lose your ferocity and battle-readiness. 
You have disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) 
checks and take a –5 penalty to initiative rolls. These 
effects can be removed with a 
greater restoration
 spell, 
but not while you are attuned to the weapon.
"
Viper Khopesh,"Weapon (scimitar), rare
This curved blade was carved from a large viper’s 
fang. When you hit with an attack using this magic 
sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage. 
In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made 
with this weapon against a Large or smaller creature, 
that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 poison 
damage and is poisoned until the start of your next turn. 
The poisoned creature is incapacitated. On a successful 
save, a creature takes half as much poison damage and 
isn’t poisoned.
"
Voyage Collar,"Wondrous item, rare
This cushioned leather and rope collar is easily 
adjustable to fit the necks of all manner of creatures. 
You can place the collar on a willing Medium or smaller 
creature using an action. If the creature is a friendly 
beast companion or familiar (such as one summoned 
by the 
find familiar
 spell), you can speak the collar’s 
command word as part of this action to create a magical 
bond between you and the creature. The bond remains 
until the collar is removed.
You can use a bonus action to speak the collar’s 
command word while you can see the bonded creature 
within 30 feet of you. When you do, the creature grows 
in size to become Large, provided there’s enough 
space. The enlarged creature gains a +2 bonus to AC 
(provided it isn’t wearing armor), its speed increases by 
10 feet, and is magically equipped with a bridle, reins, 
and saddle. The enlarged creature can understand the 
directions of any friendly creature that’s riding it, and 
its carrying capacity magically becomes the same as a 
riding horse. The creature remains enlarged for up to 8 
hours, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you end the 
effect using a bonus action. Once this property of the 
collar has been used, it can’t be used again until the next 
dawn.
If the beast or familiar wearing the collar is a 
transformed humanoid or other creature, such as by the 
polymorph
 spell or similar magic, the bond fails when 
you speak the command word and the collar has no 
effect. If the bonded creature is a familiar summoned 
by the 
find familiar
 spell, the collar and familiar 
disappear into a pocket dimension together whenever 
you temporarily dismiss it. If the bonded familiar is 
dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves the 
collar behind. A creature can only gain the benefits of 
one magical collar at a time.
"
Vyra’s Broken Path,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by an elf or 
half-elf)
This cloak once belonged to an elven archer of masterful 
skill. Its shoulders are ornamented with furs and 
seasonal leaves, and it bears a clasp at its center made 
from intertwined branches. While wearing the cloak, 
you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. As 
a bonus action, you can use a free hand to break the 
cloak’s clasp and transform the cloak into a +3 longbow 
that appears in your hand. While attuned to the cloak, 
you are proficient with this magical longbow, and your 
ranged attacks with it ignore half cover. While holding 
the bow, you can use a bonus action to speak its 
command phrase in Elvish, “The arrow’s path was true.” 
When you do, the bow transforms into the cloak again 
and appears draped around your shoulders or in your 
hand (your choice).
While the cloak or bow is on your person, you can use 
an action to focus your awareness on the surrounding 
region. For 1 hour, you can sense if any of the following 
creature types are present within 1 mile of you: 
aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, 
and undead. You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. This property 
doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number. Once 
this property of the cloak has been used, it can’t be used 
again until the next dawn.
The agreement was clear: those who weren’t kin of the elves 
had to stay on the determined path, the land outside the trail 
off limits. They did not hesitate to remind offenders that 
the woods watched for trespassers and punished for each 
trampled branch.
"
Wand of Dowsing,"Wand, uncommon (requires attunement)
This hazel wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you 
can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the 
locate object
 spell from it. When the wand is used to 
detect water, its range increases to 10 miles.
The wand regains 1d3 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, 
the wand bursts into a small cloud of harmless steam.
"
Wand of Gilding,"Wand, rare (requires attunement by a bard, sorcerer, or 
wizard)
This golden wand is a classic royal family heirloom 
and has a delicate lily at its end that flowers when held. 
While holding the wand, you can use the following 
properties:
Enhance Beauty.
 You can use an action to point the 
wand at a living target you can see within 30 feet of you 
and magically enhance its beauty for 1 hour. If the target 
is a creature, its eyelashes may become thicker, its skin 
more radiant, and its hair more luscious. If it’s a plant, 
it may grow more vibrant, smell more fragrant, and look 
visibly healthier.
Gild.
 As an action, you can touch the wand to a target 
no larger than 1 foot in any dimension to cause it to 
appear to be made of gold for 1 hour. Its appearance 
and texture change to reflect the new appearance, 
but its weight remains the same. A successful DC 15 
Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the effect 
is illusory. Once this property has been used, it can’t be 
used again until the next dawn.
This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. 
It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If 
you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, 
the wand crumbles into dirt and is destroyed.
Spells.
 While holding this wand, you can use an 
action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the 
following spells from it (save DC 15):

Appearance only), 
charm person
 (2nd-level version), 
enthrall
, or 
hypnotic pattern
.
Silver Tongue.
 While holding this wand, when you 
make a Charisma check or saving throw, you can use 
your reaction and expend 1 of its charges to make the 
roll with advantage.
"
Wand of Merriment,"Wand, very rare (requires attunement)
This wand is made from a sprig of holly and exudes 
an unmistakable aura of cheer from it. It has 10 holly 
berries that each contain 1 charge and are used to fuel 
the wand’s properties. When you expend a charge from 
a berry, it wilts away and disappears. The wand regrows 
1d6 + 4 missing berries daily at dawn. While you’re 
attuned to the wand, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma 
checks and saving throws.
Spells.
 While holding the wand, you can use an 
action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of 
the following spells (save DC 16) from it: 
create food 
and water
 (3 charges), 
goodberry
 (1 charge), 
hideous 
laughter
 (1 charge), or 
irresistible dance
 (6 charges).
Dashing through the Snow.
 While holding the wand, 
you can use a bonus action to expend 2 of its charges to 
take the Dash action. When you do, you ignore difficult 
terrain created by ice or snow. This movement doesn’t 
provoke opportunity attacks.
Festive.
 As an action, you can wave this wand over up 
to 1 gallon of water and expend 1 charge to transform 
the liquid into a weak, but pleasant-tasting, alcoholic 
beverage.
If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. 
On a 1, all but one of the wand’s leaves and berry 
stems wither away and die. When this happens, the 
wand becomes a common wand that does not require 
attunement, but has only 1 charge. This common 
version of the wand retains only the festive property of 
its original form and regains the expended charge daily 
at dawn.
"
Wand of Necrosis,"Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, 
or wizard)
This gnarled, wooden branch has grown over one of the 
severed fingers of a powerful lich, creating a gruesome 
and deadly wand. The wand has 7 charges. If the wand 
has at least 1 charge remaining, you have resistance to 
necrotic damage while you hold it.
While holding this wand, you can use an action to 
expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the 
following spells from it (save DC 15, attack bonus +7): 
"
Wand of Puppetry,"Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This wand is made of wood and looks like the handle of 
a marionette. The wand has 7 charges. While holding 
the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of 
its charges to attach a number of magical strings equal 
to the charges spent to a humanoid that you can see 
within 60 feet of you. You can attach 1 string to each of 
the creature’s limbs, including its head. For example, a 
humanoid with two legs, two arms, and only one head 
could have a maximum of 5 strings attached to it. The 
strings are invisible, but can be seen by a creature with 
a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Dealing 
10 slashing damage with a magical weapon attack to 
one of the strings (AC 10) causes it to detach and dis-
appear. At the end of each of its turns, a strung creature 
can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, breaking free 
of and destroying any number of the strings connected 
to it on a success. The strings break early if the creature 
is more than 100 feet away from you.
While a creature has a string attached to one or more 
of its limbs, the following effects occur depending on the 
location of the strings:
Arm or Hand.
 A creature with a string attached to 
one of its arms or hands must succeed on a DC 16 
Strength saving throw each time it attempts to use 
it, such as making a weapon attack, climbing a wall, 
or using an item. On a failed save, the action, attack, 
check, or saving throw fails and is lost. If an action 
requires multiple arms and only one of the creature’s 
arms has a string attached, it makes this saving throw 
with advantage. If the strung arm is holding a shield, 
the creature doesn’t gain the benefits of holding it for 
the duration. In addition, you can use an action to force 
the creature to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, 
dropping any number of items it’s holding with the 
strung arms or hands on a failure.
Head.
 A creature with a string attached to its head 
has disadvantage on Intelligence checks, Wisdom 
(Perception) checks, and Constitution saving throws 
made to maintain concentration on a spell when it takes 
damage. You can use an action to force the creature to 
speak on your turn, saying a word or phrase no longer 
than twenty-five words.
Leg.
 A creature with a string attached to one or more 
of its legs (or similar limbs) has its speed reduced by 15 
feet for each strung limb. If a flying creature’s speed is 
reduced to 0 in this way, it falls to the ground at a rate 
of 60 feet per round and takes no falling damage when 
it lands. A creature with a string attached to each of its 
legs has disadvantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks 
and Dexterity saving throws.
Spell.
 Alternatively, you can expend 5 charges to cast 
the 
dominate person
 spell (save DC 16) from the wand.
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, 
the wand becomes nonmagical.
"
Wand of Stars,"Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This antiquated, dark blue wand is adorned with a 
glowing star at its tip. When it’s swung, small specks of 
starlight drift from its end.
The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. 
It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If 
you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, 
the wand scatters into glittering dust and is destroyed.
Spells.
 While holding the wand, you can use an 
action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the 
following spells (save DC 15) from it: 
color spray
 (1 
charge per spell level, up to 3), 
daylight
 (3 charges), 
hypnotic pattern
 (3 charges), 
light
 (no charges), 
magic missile
 (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), or 
prestidigitation
 (no charges).
Starlight Wayfinder.
 While you can see stars in the 
sky and are holding the wand, you can use an action to 
call out a cardinal direction and expend 1 of its charges. 
When you do, stars in that direction appear brighter to 
you for 1 hour or until you use the wand again to call out 
a new direction.
"
Wand of the Alicorn,"Wand, legendary (requires attunement by a good-aligned 
spellcaster)
This wand was made using the horn of a unicorn 
and feather of a pegasus for the queen for Orostead, 
a powerful mage whose skilled leadership made her 
a favorite among her city’s citizens and military. The 
wand has 7 charges, which are used for the following 
properties, and regains all expended charges daily at 
dawn.
Spells.
 While holding the wand, you can use an 
action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the 
following spells (save DC 17): 
dispel evil and good
 (1 
charge), 
find steed
 (a pegasus, 1 charge), 
guiding bolt
 
(6th-level version, 1 charge, +10 to hit with ranged spell 
attack), or 
sacred flame
 (no charges, cast at 5th level).
Create Wings.
 While holding the wand, you can use 
a bonus action to expend 1 charge from the wand to 
summon a pair of magical pegasus wings from your 
back for 1 hour. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 
feet.
Alternatively, while holding the wand, you can use 
a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cause 
the wings to appear on the back of a creature you can 
see within 60 feet of you. When you do, that creature 
can immediately use its reaction to fly up to its speed, 
without provoking opportunity attacks. At the end of 
your turn, the wings vanish.
Healing Light.
 While holding the wand, you can use 
an action to expend 1 or more charges from the wand 
to cause a beam of healing light to shine down on a 
creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature 
regains 10 hit points for each charge you spend and is 
cured of either one disease or one condition afflicting 
it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, 
or poisoned. If a creature regains hit points in this way 
that would take it above its hit point maximum, that 
creature gains temporary hit points equal to the number 
of restored hit points above its hit point maximum.
"
Wand of the Frostrose,"Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This icy wand has a magical blue rose frozen at its 
center. The flower is a frostrose: a rare and delicate rose 
found only in the coldest parts of the Everglacier.
The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can 
use an action to expend up to 3 of its charges to create 
1 or more Medium ice sculptures on the ground within 
60 feet of you, creating 1 sculpture for each charge you 
expend. Each sculpture must appear in an unoccupied 
space on the ground you can see within range. Each 
sculpture is a delicate, thorned rose made of ice and is 
always a Medium object with 1 hit point and AC 12. A 
sculpture melts after 1 minute, or 8 hours if it’s in an 
area of extreme cold. If a sculpture falls to 0 hit points, 
it erupts in an icy blast and is destroyed, causing all 
creatures within 20 feet of it to make a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw. An ice sculpture caught in this explosion 
erupts automatically, intensifying the blast. A creature 
takes 3d8 piercing damage and 3d6 cold damage on 
a failed save, plus an extra 1d8 piercing damage for 
"
War’s Wager,"Weapon (greataxe), very rare (requires attunement)
This golden axe is enchanted with haphazard divination 
magic. Its split blade features a spade, club, heart, 
and diamond on each of its four faces. You gain a +1 
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic 
weapon. When you hit a target with this weapon, you 
can choose to roll a second d20 before calculating the 
weapon’s damage. If you roll an 11 or higher on the 
second d20, the blade magically seeks out and hits the 
weakest point of the target, turning the attack into a 
critical hit. On a roll of 10 or lower, the blade ricochets 
harmlessly off the original target and scores a critical hit 
against you, instead. When the axe hits you in this way, 
its damage ignores resistances and immunity.
"
Wardancer’s Spear,"Weapon (spear), rare
This double-bladed spear is extraordinarily light and 
perfectly balanced for use with one hand. While holding 
this magic spear with one hand, it has the finesse 
property. Whenever you take the Attack action and make 
a melee attack with the spear using only one hand, you 
can use a bonus action to make an additional attack 
with the spear. You don’t add your ability modifier to 
the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is 
negative.
Immediately after you use your bonus action in this 
way, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking 
opportunity attacks, though you can’t move farther than 
your remaining movement would allow.
"
Warding Staff,"Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)
This platinum staff has a wide brazier on top with a 
small crystal orb that floats above it. While holding the 
staff, its brazier is lit with harmless, holy flames that 
shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an 
additional 20 feet. The staff can be wielded as a magic 
quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals an extra 1d6 radiant 
damage.
A friendly creature within reach of the staff can use 
its bonus action to remove the crystal orb that floats 
above the brazier. While the orb is on their person, that 
creature is under the effect of the 
warding bond
 spell as 
if you cast it. The spell lasts until the orb is more than 
60 feet away from you, until you’re no longer holding the 
staff, or until you die or are incapacitated. You can also 
choose to mentally end the spell at any time (no action 
required). When the spell ends, the orb teleports back to 
the head of the staff.
In addition, while a creature other than you that you 
can see is carrying the orb, you can use a bonus action 
to speak the orb’s command word and teleport up to 60 
feet to an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 
feet of that creature. Alternatively, a creature holding the 
orb can use its bonus action to speak the orb’s command 
word and teleport to an unoccupied space that it can 
see within 5 feet of you instead. This property of the orb 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Warhammer of Eruptions,"Weapon (warhammer), rare (requires attunement)
This sturdy warhammer has a core of magma at its 
center that heats up during combat. You gain a +1 
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic 
weapon.
Eruption.
 The first time that the warhammer hits a 
target in combat, it starts to release a steady stream 
of embers and smoke. When this happens, and while 
the hammer is smoldering in this way, it deals an extra 
1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. At the end of each 
of your turns while the hammer is smoldering, its fire 
becomes increasingly unstable. At the end of the third 
turn, the hammer erupts, spraying lava and releasing a 
volcanic storm from it in a 30-foot cone in a direction of 
your choice (no action required). Each creature in the 
area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 lightning damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. The lava then vanishes. The warhammer cools and 
doesn’t erupt if combat ends or if you drop or stow the 
weapon before it erupts. Once the warhammer erupts, it 
loses this property until 2d6 hours have passed.
"
Warp Anchor,"Rod, rare
This pair of batons magically link together to form a 
complete rod, causing a purple mist to swirl between 
the two glass orbs on either of its ends. While holding 
the rod or its batons, you can use an action to speak the 
rod’s first command word to split it into the batons or 
recombine them again.
While holding one of the split batons, you can use an 
action to speak the rod’s second command word to cast 
the 
teleport
 spell from it, teleporting only yourself to an 
unoccupied space within 5 feet of the other baton, even 
if it’s on another plane of existence. Once this property 
has been used, it can’t be used again until the batons 
have spent at least 12 hours recombined as the rod, at 
which point the swirling mist reappears within the orbs.
"
Waterskin of Voices,"Wondrous item, uncommon
This leather waterskin has a magical beverage inside 
that allows you to briefly alter your voice. When found, 
the waterskin has 1d6 + 4 servings. You can drink 1 
of the servings while holding the waterskin using an 
action. When you do, choose a voice from a creature 
you’ve heard or one from your imagination. The next 
25 words you speak within 10 minutes sound virtually 
indistinguishable from the voice you chose, though a 
successful DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that 
the voice is magically altered. If the voice you chose 
belongs to another creature, that creature automatically 
knows that the voice is altered.
"
Wavecutter,"Weapon (any axe), rare
This axe has a single pearl set at the center of its blade. 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. When you take the Attack 
action using this axe, you can forgo one of your attacks 
to swing the axe in front of you and speak its command 
word. When you do, the axe emits a crashing wave of 
magical water. The wave is 10 feet tall and extends from 
you in a 30-foot cone, after which it spreads out across 
the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected 
flames in the area within 30 feet of it before the water 
vanishes. Each creature within the cone must make 
a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked 
prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as 
much damage and isn’t knocked prone. This property 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
"
Wayfinder Sphere,"Wondrous item, rare
This spinning metal sphere is 6 inches in diameter and 
weighs 5 pounds. You can tap the orb twice as an action 
to activate it. While activated, the orb records basic 
details about the space that it can see within 100 feet. 
The orb has darkvision out to 100 feet, but can’t see 
through heavily obscured areas or illusions. Tapping it 
twice again deactivates the orb.
The activated orb can display its recorded maps. 
If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak its first 
command word, followed by a description of a location 
it’s mapped. For example, you can command the orb 
to recall the entrance to a series of catacombs you 
explored 2 days ago, or the path you took to get through 
a twisting labyrinth. When you do, an illusory map 
appears in a 5-foot sphere centered on the orb that 
shows basic details about the recorded area, such as 
buildings, pathways, roads, signs, topography, and 
trees. While you’re within 5 feet of the map, you can 
use a series of intuitive gestures to change the map’s 
rotation, displayed location, or scale: showing as little 
of the recorded area as a 25-foot radius, or as much 
as a 1-mile radius. Speaking the command word again 
causes the map to vanish.
If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak a second 
command word as an action to make the orb rise into 
"
Weapon of Verdict,"Weapon (any melee weapon), uncommon (requires 
attunement by a creature of good alignment)
These polished wooden weapons are traditionally 
used by the clerics and paladins of a righteous order to 
punish evildoers and aid the needy. Each of these magic 
weapons is blessed by a powerful priest or celestial. 
A 
weapon of verdict
 has 3 charges and regains 1d3 
charges daily at dawn. You can use these charges to 
create the following effects:
Condemn.
 When you hit a creature with this weapon, 
you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d8 fire 
damage to the target.
Commend.
 As an action, you can expend 1 charge to 
touch a creature other than yourself with this weapon to 
restore 1d8 + 2 hit points to that creature.
"
Weaving Wasp Needles,"Weapon (dart), uncommon
This pair of dark, chiseled throwing needles are linked 
by a magical bond. A needle that hits a Large or smaller 
creature flies around it for 1 minute or until the creature 
falls to 0 hit points. If both needles fly around the 
same creature, they spin a magical thread that binds 
and restrains it. The creature is restrained until freed 
or until you take a bonus action to speak the needles’ 
command word to release it. A creature can use its 
action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself 
or another creature within its reach on a success. Once 
the needles restrain a creature in this way, this property 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
In addition, you can use the needles as a set of 
weaver’s tools. These magical needles can act on their 
own to either mend a simple tear or craft a simple 
garment given the proper materials in 1 minute or over 
the course of a short rest, respectively. As an action, you 
can speak the needles’ other command word, followed 
by a description of the task, to cause them to spring 
to life and begin sewing and crafting. Uttering this 
command word again causes them to stop early and fall 
to the ground.
"
Webgrip Bow,"Weapon (any bow), rare (requires attunement)
This 8-armed bow uses the remains of a spindly spider’s 
legs and maw. The bow has 3 charges and regains all 
expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a 
ranged attack with the bow, you can expend 1 of its 
charges to lace it with sticky spider silk. On a hit, the 
arrow magically sheds the silk and releases it as a net-
like web. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it 
and each Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of it 
must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be 
restrained until the end of your next turn. If the target 
is a Large creature, only it must succeed on the saving 
throw instead. Huge and larger creatures are unaffected 
by the web.
Summon Spiders.
 While holding the weapon, 
you can use an action to speak its command word 
to summon 2 swarms of insects (spiders) or 1 giant 
spider, which appear in unoccupied spaces that you can 
see within 10 feet of you. The GM has the creatures’ 
statistics. The summoned creatures are friendly to you 
and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned 
creatures as a group, which have their own turns. They 
obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no 
action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands 
to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, 
but otherwise take no actions. A summoned creature 
disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, after 1 hour, or 
when you end the effect early as a bonus action. Once 
this property of the bow has been used, it can’t be used 
again until the next dawn.
"
Whirling Weapons,"Weapon (any melee weapon without the special or two-
handed property), rare
These magic weapons were forged with lightweight 
metals and designed for speed rather than brute force. 
Whirling weapons
 have the finesse and light properties 
and whistle softly when swung through the air. When 
you take the Attack action and attack with a 
whirling 
weapon
 that you’re holding in one hand, you can use 
a bonus action to make another attack with the same 
weapon. You don’t add your ability modifier to the 
damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is 
negative. If you’re holding a different 
whirling weapon
 
in each hand and engage in two-weapon fighting, you 
can make one attack with each weapon when you use a 
bonus action in this way.
In addition, if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting 
fighting style, you can add your ability modifier to the 
damage of the bonus attacks.
"
Whirlpool Dart,"Weapon (dart), uncommon
This dart feels cold and hefty in the hand, but flies 
effortlessly when thrown. As an action, you can 
throw this dart at a point within 20 feet of you and 
speak its command word to cause it to create a wild, 
spiraling whirlpool in a 15-foot-radius, 10-foot-high 
cylinder centered on that point. Each creature in the 
area excluding you must make a DC 13 Strength 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 
bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 15 feet toward 
the center of the cylinder. On a successful save, a 
creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pulled.
In addition, unsecured objects that are completely 
within the cylinder are automatically pulled 15 feet 
toward the center by this effect, and all nonmagical 
flames within the cylinder are extinguished.
The dart’s property can’t be used again until the next 
dawn. In the meantime, the dart can still be used as a 
magic weapon.
"
Whispergust Mote,"Wondrous item, common
A 
whispergust mote
 is a sentient breath of air typically 
separated from a larger air elemental. When not 
invisible, its form resembles a dollop of blue whipped 
cream but is weightless and fluid to the touch. The mote 
can use an action to become invisible, but it typically 
"
Widemouth Bucket,"Wondrous item, common
This brass bucket in the shape of a fish’s open mouth 
is 12-inches across and tall and weighs 3 pounds while 
it isn’t filled. The bucket can hold up to 10 gallons of 
liquid, even though it appears to hold only 1. Regardless 
of how much liquid is inside, the bucket’s weight is only 
increased by the weight of up to 1 gallon of the liquid.
"
Widow’s Tea,"Wondrous item, rare
This dark ceramic tea set comes with a teapot and two 
matching teacups. The malignant spirit of a hag lives 
within the teapot and corrupts the first cup of tea that 
it pours into one of the matching teacups. The first 
creature that drinks this cup of tea must make a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw as the hag’s spirit assaults 
it from the inside. On a failed save, a creature takes 
4d6 poison damage and is paralyzed for 1 minute. 
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much 
damage and isn’t paralyzed. At the end of each of its 
turns, a paralyzed creature can make another DC 
15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a 
success.
Once this property has been used, it can’t be used 
again until 5 days have passed.
"
Wildfire Ammunition,"Weapon (arrow or bolt), rare
This ammunition smolders while you hold it, sparking 
softly with simmering embers. When you use this arrow 
or bolt to make a ranged weapon attack, it vanishes 
in a scattering of sparks immediately after it’s fired: 
disappearing into a special extradimensional space 
without hitting a target. The ammunition’s flames burn 
hotter the longer it remains in this space and can stay 
there for up to 3 rounds.
You can use a bonus action on your turn to speak the 
ammunition’s command word and choose a point you 
can see within 120 feet of where you fired it from. When 
you do, the arrow or bolt reappears directly above the 
point and explodes, creating a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-
high cylinder of searing flames centered on that point. 
Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 fire 
damage, plus an extra 2d8 fire damage for every round 
the ammunition remained in its pocket dimension. On 
a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
If the ammunition remains in its extradimensional 
space for the full duration without its command word 
being spoken, it reappears and explodes above a random 
point within 120 feet of where it was fired.
An arrow or bolt is destroyed when it explodes in 
this way.
"
Wildskin Armor,"Armor (hide), uncommon (requires attunement by a druid)
This enchanted hide armor magically conforms to your 
body and moves naturally with your movements.
While wearing this armor, you can choose to have it 
reinforce your new form when you use your Wild Shape. 
When you do, your AC while you are transformed is 
equal to 14 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2), 
unless it’s already higher. You gain this benefit even 
if the armor merges into your new form. Once this 
property has been used, it can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
"
Williwig’s Time Stopper,"Wondrous item, common
This magic bottle stopper’s base is made of a mixture 
of cork and metal, but a stony, gargoyle figurine with a 
bored expression rests atop it. You can seal or unseal 
a bottle, flask, jar, waterskin, or similar container with 
the stopper as an action. When you do, the stopper 
magically resizes to fit the container’s opening (up to 6 
inches in diameter). While a container is stoppered in 
this way, any nonliving liquid inside it doesn’t age, decay, 
rot, or spoil. If the container has a tap or similar means 
of dispensing the liquid without unstoppering it (such 
as a keg), the effect on the liquid ends once it leaves the 
vessel.
"
Wind Riders,"Wondrous item, rare
These boots look and feel like pale, dried leaves but are 
remarkably soft and quiet to walk in. While wearing 
these boots, you can move normally in difficult terrain 
caused by strong winds.
While wearing these boots, you can use an action to 
speak their command word to cast the 
gaseous form
 
spell, transforming yourself into a swirling cloud of 
vapor and leaves. This version of the spell lasts for up 
to 1 minute, but only allows you to float vertically using 
your movement speed. Your horizontal movement speed 
while in this form is decided by the direction and speed 
of the wind. A wind of light speed (between 5 and 10 
miles per hour) propels you 10 feet per round, whereas 
a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles 
per hour) pushes you 20 feet instead.
Traveling somewhere while in this form where the 
swirling leaves are unable to follow you ends the effect 
early. Once the boots have been used to cast this spell, 
they can’t do so again until the next dawn.
"
Wind and Whirl,"Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)
This pair of scimitars was forged in the Elemental Plane 
of Air and cut effortlessly through the air in tandem. 
Attuning to one of the scimitars automatically attunes 
you to both of them, which count as one attuned item.
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with these magic weapons, which have the thrown 
property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range 
of 60 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack 
with one of the scimitars, it flies back to your hand. In 
addition, when you engage in two-weapon fighting using 
both scimitars, you can add your ability modifier to the 
damage of the second attack.
As an action, you can speak the scimitars’ command 
words and throw the two swords at a point you can 
see within 60 feet of you. The two weapons spin wildly 
and create a sudden whirlwind in a 15-foot-radius, 
30-foot-high cylinder centered on the point. A target 
caught in the whirlwind’s area must make a DC 15 
Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 
6d6 bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away 
from the point in a random direction and knocked 
prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a 
wall or floor, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage 
for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at 
another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 
15 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and 
be knocked prone. On a successful save, a target takes 
half as much bludgeoning damage and isn’t flung away 
or knocked prone. The scimitars fly back to your hands 
immediately after the effect. Once this property of the 
scimitars has been used, it can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
"
Wind-Up Merchant,"Wondrous item, rare
This soft toy figurine is 5 inches tall and weighs 1 
pound. You can use an action to wind up the toy using 
a crank in the back, causing it to release a thin strip of 
parchment listing 3 magic items and their costs from 
the list below. The toy then whirs and animates slowly, 
walking and bowing slightly, and can’t be wound up 
again until 24 hours have passed.
Roll 3d12, recording each number rolled, to 
determine which of the following magic items are 
listed on the parchment. At the GM’s discretion, reroll 
duplicate results.

While the toy is animated, you can use an action 
to deposit any number of coins into the slot on the 
toy’s belly and speak the name of an item listed on the 
parchment. If the value of the coins deposited in the toy 
is equal to or greater than the cost of the named item, 
the item magically appears in your hand or at your feet 
(your choice) and is removed from the parchment. The 
spent coins are then lost.
The toy remains animated for 5 minutes or until 
each item has been purchased from the list. When the 
toy stops animating, any deposited coins that weren’t 
spent on the listed items clatter to the ground below it, 
converting them into smaller denominations as needed, 
and the parchment turns to dust and is destroyed.
An item purchased from the 
wind-up merchant
 
disappears after 24 hours, or early if you attempt to sell 
or trade it to another creature.
"
Wisp Cloak,"Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This near-weightless cloak billows softly even without 
wind. While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on 
death saving throws and can move normally through the 
space of any Medium or smaller creature once on each 
of your turns, but can’t stop there.
Curse.
 This cloak is cursed by the spirit of a person 
who was betrayed by a close friend. Once you wear this 
cursed cloak, you can’t remove it unless you are targeted 
by the 
remove curse
 spell or similar magic. While 
wearing the cloak, whenever you move or end your turn 
within 10 feet of a friendly creature with 0 hit points for 
the first time on each of your turns, that creature must 
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 
a failed death saving throw.
"
Wispy Sour,"Potion, common or uncommon
The typical 
wispy sour
, a common potion, is a specialty 
alcoholic beverage that causes you to float harmlessly off 
the floor. When you drink this potion, you gain a flying 
speed of 10 feet for 1 minute, but can only hover 1 foot 
above the ground when doing so. The drink is smooth, 
sweet, and has a slight aftertaste of ash. A tiny, single 
light from the 
dancing lights
 spell is often cast within 
the drink when served. Due to its magical nature, the 
alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as 
much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
The following 
wispy sour
 is an uncommon variant 
with additional properties. It also tastes better.
For 1 minute after drinking this potion, you can regain 
1d8 + 2 hit points once on each of your turns when you 
reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points. If the creature 
is a construct or undead, you don’t regain any hit points 
in this way. This variant contains a harmless will-o’-wisp 
fragment. Hazy visions of lost souls occasionally drift 
through the drink’s cheery liquid.
"
Wraps of the Restless,"Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
These salvaged wrappings from the arms of a mummy 
lord hang loosely from your arms but never seem to 
slide off. While wearing the wraps, you have resistance 
to necrotic damage.
In addition, when you take the Attack action while 
wearing the wraps, you can use a bonus action 
immediately before or after one of your attacks to cause 
a piece of the wrapping to lash out at a target within 10 
feet of you. Make a melee spell attack for the wrapping, 
using an attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the target takes 
1d8 necrotic damage.
The wraps have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can hold out 
your hand and expend 1 or more of the wraps’ charges 
to release a blast of sand from it in a 15-foot cone. Each 
creature in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded 
until the start of your next turn, and for each charge 
you spend, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus 2d8 
necrotic damage. On a successful save, a creature takes 
half as much damage and isn’t blinded.
Curse.
 Once you don these cursed wraps, you can’t 
doff them unless you are targeted by the 
remove curse
 
spell or similar magic. While wearing the wraps, you 
have disadvantage on attack rolls against undead and on 
saving throws against their spells and special abilities. 
In addition, while cursed, you don’t recover as much 
from resting. When you roll Hit Dice to regain hit points, 
roll each one of the dice twice and use the lower result.
"
Wyrmling Wristlet,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This bracelet has 1d6 + 3 colorful, egg-shaped beads 
hanging from it. Ten types of beads exist. The GM 
decides the type of each bead on the bracelet or 
determines it randomly. A bracelet can have more than 
one bead of the same type. You can use an action to 
detach a bead and throw it into an unoccupied space 
that you can see up to 30 feet away from you. When it 
reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead cracks open, 
destroying the bead, and summons a dragon wyrmling 
in the space. The type of wyrmling is determined by the 
bead’s color.

A summoned wyrmling disappears after 1 hour, when 
it drops to 0 hit points, or when you summon another 
wyrmling. The wyrmling shares your initiative count, 
but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It is friendly 
to you and your companions until you threaten or harm 
it. The wyrmling obeys any verbal commands that 
you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t 
issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile 
creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.
When the last bead has been used, the wristlet 
becomes nonmagical.
"
Wyrmshide Bow,"Weapon (shortbow), rare (requires attunement)
This bow is crafted with delicate dragon scales and 
strung with a fiber from a dragon’s heart. While holding 
the bow, you can use a bonus action to speak its 
command word and channel the energy of the dragon 
within. When you do, the bow forms a draconic cowl of 
elemental energy around you. For the duration of the 
cowl, you gain the following benefits:
 
y
 You gain 25 temporary hit points, which last for 1 
minute.
 
y
 You have resistance to damage of the same type as 
the elemental energy of the cowl. The type of energy 
is determined by the kind of dragon that provided 
the bow’s scales, as shown on the table below.
 
y
 On a hit, the bow deals an extra 1d8 damage of the 
same type as the cowl’s energy. If the target is a 
dragon, this extra damage ignores any resistance or 
immunity it has against that damage type.
The cowl remains until you lose all these temporary 
points. Once this property has been used, it can’t be 
used again until the next dawn or until the bow is used 
to slay or help slay a Large or larger dragon. For the 
purpose of this weapon, “dragon” refers to any creature 
with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and 
wyverns.

Xibalban Blade,"Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)
This toothed obsidian blade absorbs any blood that’s left 
on it. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature 
that is not a construct, plant, or undead with this sword, 
that creature takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.
If the sword has dealt necrotic damage in this way in 
the past hour, you can use an action to hold the sword 
aloft and speak its command word to summon a blood 
elemental, as if you had cast the 
conjure elemental
 spell. 
Once this property of the sword has been used, it can’t 
be used again until the next dawn. A blood elemental 
uses the same statistics as a water elemental, with the 
following changes:
 
y
 The blood elemental has resistance to necrotic 
damage in addition to its other resistances.
 
y
 The blood elemental’s alignment is neutral evil.
When you hit with an attack using this sword while 
the blood elemental is under your control and within 
120 feet of you, the elemental regains a number of hit 
points equal to the necrotic damage dealt by the sword.
"
Xorn-Sole Boots,"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This pair of iron-toed boots is made with the rocky 
leather hide of a xorn. Each boot is secured with three 
golden buttons bearing the icon of an eye and has 
several claw-like spikes extending from its toe and heel. 
While wearing these boots, you can use a bonus action 
to speak their command word and click the boots’ heels 
together. If you do, you gain tremorsense out to a range 
of 30 feet and a burrowing speed equal to your walking 
speed. If you click your heels together again, you end the 
effect.
You can use this property for up to 10 minutes, all 
at once or in several shorter bursts, each one using a 
minimum of 1 minute from the duration. During this 
time, you can pinpoint the location of precious metals 
and stones, such as coins and gems, within the range of 
your tremorsense.
When the boots’ property has been used for a total of 
10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish 
a long rest.
"
Yellow Harbinger’s Path,"Armor (light or medium), very rare (requires attunement by 
a creature with a Dexterity score of 17 or higher)
This burnt yellow armor is the mark of a royal scout. Its 
magical construction is unyielding to all but the most 
lithe and capable of scouts and huntsmen.
While wearing the armor, you gain a +5 bonus to any 
Dexterity (Stealth) check you make. While you have 
more than half your Hit Dice remaining, you can choose 
to expend 2 of them as an action to extend this property 
to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you for 1 
hour. When you do, each affected creature, including 
yourself, has advantage on initiative rolls and can’t 
be tracked except by magical means. A creature only 
benefits from this effect if it remains within 30 feet of 
you.
The armor has 7 charges and regains all expended 
charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you 
can expend 1 or more of its charges to use one of the 
following properties:
“At Arrow’s Length!”
 When a creature that you 
can see within 60 feet of you uses its reaction to make 
an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction to 
expend 1 of the armor’s charges to summon a spectral 
arrow from the air above it. The arrow flies harmlessly 
in front of the attacking creature and disappears, 
distracting them from the attack and causing the roll 
to be made with disadvantage. If the attacking creature 
has blindsight, this property has no effect. If you’re 
concentrating on the 
hunter’s mark
 spell, you can 
choose to move your mark to this creature as part of 
your reaction.
Alternatively, if a hostile creature ends its turn within 
5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend 2 
charges to immediately move up to half your speed, 
without provoking opportunity attacks.
“From Sky to Earth!”
 As an action, you can expend 4 
charges from the armor to summon a volley of spectral 
arrows from the sky, choosing a point that you can see 
within 120 feet of you when you do. The arrows fall in 
a 30-foot radius, 60-foot high cylinder centered on that 
point and then disappear. Each creature in the area 
must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 
force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one.
“There Is No Escape!”
 You can use a bonus action 
to expend up to 3 of the armor’s charges to cast the 
hunter’s mark
 spell from it. If you choose to expend 2 
charges, you cast the spell at 3rd level, or 5th level if you 
choose to expend 3.
Flaw.
 The 
Yellow Harbinger’s path
 compels its wearer 
to be cautious and overprepared. While attuned to the 
armor, you gain the following flaw: “I am duty-bound to 
lay out the perfect plan for every situation. Uncertainty 
is unacceptable.” In addition, if you are attuned to the 
armor for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment 
to duty extends to the person you trust most. You or 
your GM determine who this person is. You consider 
this person your field commander and put their plans 
ahead of your own and trust them implicitly. You can’t 
attune to the 
Red Queen’s burden
 or the 
Violet King’s 
promise
. If you’re already attuned to either of them, 
your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect 
is extended to you. The first creature you meet who 
is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your 
field commander, regardless of who you previously 
considered it to be. You become charmed by them and 
obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you 
find the 
Red Queen’s burden
 or 
Violet King’s promise
 
without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with 
your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects 
can be removed with a 
greater restoration
 spell, but not 
while you are attuned to the armor.
"
"Arista, Wand of the Spire","Wand, artifact (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This elegant silver and gold wand was crafted by the 
archmages that first arrived in Orostead centuries ago, 
well before the magical fallout of the Upheaval. It has 
been carefully used by only the extremely powerful 
or clever for generations. The wand has 7 charges for 
some of the following properties. It regains all expended 
charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last 
charge and are not a wizard, roll a d20. On a 1, the 
wand vanishes and returns to a secret vault within The 
Spire of Aristaeus, the legendary wizarding tower in 
Orostead.
Variant Properties.
 Some properties of this artifact 
are locked behind layers of dormant magic. As you grow 
stronger and reach certain milestones, these properties 
may become available to you. This wand can have up 
to 3 of the following properties active at a time. When 
you attune to 
Arista
, you can choose to activate up to 3 
of its variant properties whose prerequisites you meet. 
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace any of 
the activated properties with another one.

Once the wand has been used to cast a spell, it can’t 
be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
 
◯
 While holding the wand, you can use an action to 
expend 1 of its charges to cast the 
magic missile

2nd level instead, and is cast at 3rd level once you 
reach 13th.

◯
 (Prerequisite: 9th level)
 While holding the wand, 
you can use an action to expend 2 of its charges to 
create one of the following effects, using your spell 
save DC:
Drilling Gust.
 You harness the ever-present 
winds of Lake Ils and tighten them into a magic, 
twisting spear. The spear flies from the wand 
and forms a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide, 
piercing through any creature in the area. Each 
creature in the line must make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 
3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 cold damage and 
is pushed 15 feet away from you. If a creature 
fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also 
knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature 
takes half as much damage from the effect and 
isn’t pushed.
Siphoning Vortex.
 You conjure the strange 
undercurrents of Lake Ils and create a magical 
whirlpool in a 15-foot-radius circle at a point 
on the ground you can see within 60 feet of 
"
"Hatred, the Wrathful Edge","Weapon (greataxe), artifact (requires attunement by a 
creature the axe deems worthy)
This black iron axe was forged in the scorching fires 
of the Magmarath Caldera and has been the decisive 
end for countless mortal souls. Used as the mark 
of a Tribunal in the caldera’s city, the weapon is an 
embodiment of anger and spite, and has been enchanted 
with blood magic that bubbles to the surface each time 
it’s used to end a life. Glimmering veins of lava flicker 
from its dark metal surface, and roiling, volcanic sparks 
trail behind it in its wake when swung.
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 2d6 fire 
or lightning damage (your choice) to any target it hits. 
When you reduce a living creature to 0 hit points using 
this weapon, you gain a number of temporary hit points 
equal to the fire or lightning damage dealt as part of the 
attack.
Explosive Rage.
 If you’re a barbarian, the first time 
you enter a rage after finishing a short or long rest, up to 
6 creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take 4d6 
fire or lightning damage (your choice). In addition, while 
raging, any creature that touches you or hits you with a 
melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes 1d6 fire or 
lightning damage (your choice).
Fiendish Mind.
 You can speak, read, and write 
Abyssal and Infernal while attuned to this weapon.

 You are immune to fire damage 
while attuned to this weapon. In addition, you can 
stand on and walk across molten rock as if it were solid 
ground.
Sentience.
 
Hatred
,
 the Wrathful Edge
 is a sentient 
chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a 
Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and 
darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
The weapon communicates telepathically with its 
wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, 
Common and Infernal.
Personality.
 The weapon enjoys the sensation of 
anger. It sees all conflict eventually reaching the same 
violent conclusion, and encourages its wielder to seek 
out such hasty and bloody resolutions.
Destroying the Axe.
 The only way to destroy the 
axe is to dispel the malevolent spirit within it over time 
from the Upper Planes. Casting 
dispel evil and good
 
on the weapon every day for 5 years while on an Upper 
Plane causes the wrathful spirit within it to eventually 
succumb and perish. When the spirit leaves the axe, it 
loses all of its properties except for its bonus to attack 
and damage rolls, but becomes no harder to destroy 
than a normal magic weapon.
"
"Morath, Scepter of the Soul Vortex","Rod, artifact (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or 
wizard)
This torch-like scepter almost hums with necrotic 
energy and appeared when the first soul was returned 
to the Material Plane after its death. Since then, it has 
been lost and found throughout its gruesome, storied 
history.
While attuned to the rod, you have resistance to 
necrotic damage, and you know the 
chill touch
 cantrip 
as if it were from your class’s spell list. If you are a 
warlock, you also gain a +3 bonus to your spell attack 
rolls and saving throw DCs of your warlock spells while 
holding the rod.
An eerie, green flame erupts from the head of this 
rod when you hold it, shedding bright light in a 20-foot 
radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While 
holding the rod, you can use a bonus action to mentally 
snuff out or relight the flames. While the flames are lit, 
you can use an action to make a ranged spell attack with 
it, using your spell attack bonus, out to a range of 30 
feet. When you do, the flaming rod emits a phantasmal 
skull that flies out to attack the target. On a hit, the 
target takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and if the target 
is a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the 
amount of necrotic damage dealt. The skull disappears 
immediately after the attack.
Random Properties.
 
Morath
,
 Scepter of the Soul 
Vortex
 has the following random properties:
 
y
 1 minor beneficial property
 
y
 1 minor detrimental property
 
y
 1 major detrimental property
Spells.
 The rod has 8 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 
expended charges daily at dawn. When you reduce a 
humanoid to 0 hit points, the rod regains 1 expended 
charge. While holding the rod, you can use an action 
to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the 
following spells from it, using your spell attack bonus 
and spell save DC: 
bestow curse
 (1 charge), 
circle of 
death
 (4 charges), 
confusion
 (2 charges), 
insect plague
 
(3 charges), 
ray of enfeeblement
 (1 charge), or 
speak 
with dead
 (1 charge).
Bestow Greater Curse.
 When you cast the 
bestow 
curse
 spell while holding the rod using either the rod or 
a spell slot, you can choose to force the creature to make 
the saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the 
target is simultaneously cursed by all four of the spell’s 
listed options. Once this property has been used, it can’t 
be used again until the next dawn.
Death Grip.
 While holding the rod, you can use an 
action to cast the 
finger of death
 spell from it, using your 
spell save DC. Once the rod has been used to cast this 
spell, it can’t do so again until the next dawn.
Sentience.
 
Morath
,
 Scepter of the Soul Vortex
 is 
a sentient chaotic evil rod with an Intelligence of 17, 
a Wisdom of 13, and Charisma of 14. It has hearing 
and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The rod 
communicates telepathically with its wielder and can 
speak, read, and understand Common. While you 
are attuned to it, it also understands every language 
you know. It can choose to communicate with other 
creatures by manifesting the phantasmal skull above the 
rod and using it to speak.
Personality.
 The rod is possessed by Morath, the 
first human to ever die, and is an independent spirit 
from within the Thousand Voices, the largest collection 
of discordant lost souls found within the multiverse. 
Morath’s time on the Material Plane was short, but filled 
with pain and confusion. As a result, Morath seeks to 
experience humankind’s most base desires vicariously 
through the actions of the rod’s wielder, often attempting 
to compel the wielder to give in to such urges in 
moments of weakness.
Curse.
 The rod bears a curse that affects any 
non-human that becomes attuned to it. Even if the 
attunement ends, the curse remains. When you die 
while cursed in this way, you must make a Charisma 
saving throw against your own spell save DC. On a failed 
save, or if the rod is more than 100 feet away from you 
when you die, your soul is immediately siphoned into 
and becomes a part of the Thousand Voices, leaving 
your body a vacant husk and unable to return to life 
by any means short of a 
wish
 spell. On a successful 
save, your soul leaves your body and enters the rod, as 
if you had cast the 
magic jar
 spell, using the rod as a 
container. You can only return to your body if it’s holding 
the rod, but can otherwise gain the benefits of the spell 
as normal. If your soul returns to your body, you return 
to life with 1 hit point. While your soul is detached from 
your body in this way, your attunement to the rod is 
carried over to any other creature you possess for the 
duration.
Destroying the Scepter.
 The only way to destroy the 
rod is to destroy Morath while your soul is contained 
within the rod. When you do, use your original body’s 
statistics and abilities for your soul, with the exception 
that your hit point maximum is halved. Use the 
archmage stat block for Morath’s soul. From outside the 
rod, this combat resolves instantaneously, regardless of 
how much time passed within the rod during the battle. 
If you die while within the rod in this way, your soul is 
lost to the Thousand Voices. If Morath dies, the rod is 
destroyed and you return to your body with 1 hit point, 
regardless of where your body is at the time.

"Nimbus, First Staff of the Thunderbirds","Staff, artifact (requires attunement)
This ancient staff was created when a piece of driftwood 
was struck by lightning, fusing it to a twisted length of 
glass made from the sand on which it laid. Revered by 
the Rocborne nomads and other worldly travelers, this 
one-of-a-kind crook carries with it the power of storms, 
tempests, and the wind spirits that control them. When 
it appears, it falls from the sky in the eye of a storm or a 
flash of lightning.
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that 
grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
it. In addition, when you attack with the staff, you can 
choose to make a special ranged attack with it instead. 
This attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 
feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Wisdom 
modifier to its attack and damage rolls. On a hit, it deals 
1d6 bludgeoning damage as a gust of magical wind 
batters the target.

 You gain 
the benefits of all of this staff’s variant properties. 
In addition, if you are a ranger, you can summon a 
roc to your location by spending 8 hours performing 
an ancient Rocborne ritual. The roc is friendly 
toward you and your companions, its Intelligence 
becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand 
one language of your choice that you speak. Once 
this property of the staff has been used, it can’t be 
used again until you dismiss the roc using an action 
or until the roc dies. If the roc dies, this property 
can’t be used again for 30 days.
Destroying Nimbus.
 The only way to destroy 
Nimbus
,
 
First Staff of the Thunderbirds
 is to keep it in a vacuum 
for 10 years, depriving it of any air, at which point the 
staff cracks open to release the swirling storm inside it. 
If the force of the released storm causes the vacuum to 
end, the storm escapes and continues to rage above that 
location for 1 year.

"Silverwind, the Cleansing Breeze","Weapon (longsword), artifact (requires attunement)
This mighty longsword once belonged to Syre, the fey 
lord of the now fallen Syre Wood. This ancient blade

Betrayer, you are immediately attuned to it. When this 
happens, you can choose to immediately end your 
attunement to one of your other magical items, even 
if it’s cursed (as if by the 
remove curse
 spell or similar 
magic). If you are already attuned to your maximum 
number of magic items, you must end your attunement 
to one of them in this way.
Variant Properties.
 Some properties of this artifact 
are locked behind layers of dormant magic. As you grow 
stronger and reach certain milestones, these properties 
may become available to you. This weapon can have up 
to 3 of the following properties active at a time. When 
you attune to

You can use an action to touch a

 (Prerequisite: 14th level) 
While holding this 
sword, you can use a bonus action to create an 
illusory copy of yourself in an unoccupied space 
you can see within 30 feet of you. You choose what 
direction your copy is facing. The copy mimics 
your movements and attacks with this sword until 
the end of your turn, moving forward, turning, 
and attacking to match your actions relative to 
its position. The copy can’t walk through walls or 
other solid surfaces. The copy uses your attack 
and damage rolls for any attack you make with this 
sword, dealing force damage instead of slashing 
on a hit. The copy vanishes at the end of your 
turn. If the copy is in an unoccupied space when it 
vanishes, you can choose to teleport to its space.

restrained until the end of your next turn. If the 
target is a fiend, it’s petrified until the end of your 
next turn instead.

of this sword’s variant properties, including those 
whose prerequisites you don’t meet.
Destroying Silverwind.

The Griffon’s Saddlebag,"Wondrous item, artifact
These leather bags have the stylized face of a griffon on 
their front and appear across the multiverse in strange 
locations. One may be found in the belly of a dragon, 
while another in the limbs of a great tree. Regardless 
of where it’s found, a 
Griffon’s Saddlebag
 is typically 
discovered by an adventurer with a destiny.
The saddlebags are made by a great, six-armed griffon 
on the Astral Plane. Believed by some to be a demigod 
of pocket dimensions and craftsmen everywhere, the 
griffon is a patron of artificers and creators across the 
multiverse. The griffon creates magical items in its great 
forge using materials collected from various planes of 
existence to add to its collection. While no one knows 
exactly how to contact the griffon, it has a knack for 
knowing what items are needed by whom.
Superior Holding.
 This 1-foot-wide bag always 
weighs 3 pounds, regardless of what’s inside it. It 
functions as a 
bag of holding
 that can only be pierced 
by another artifact. Placing a 
bag of holding
, 
handy 
haversack
, 
portable hole
, or similar item inside the 
extradimensional space created by the saddlebag, or 
vice versa, destroys the extradimensional item but 
leaves the saddlebag unharmed. Any item stored within 
the other extradimensional space is magically moved 
to the space within the saddlebag instead. If doing so 
overloads the bag, random contents from either space 
are scattered in the Astral Plane.
Magic Courier. 
At the GM’s discretion, the 
saddlebag’s beak opens up to reveal a letter. The magical 
script can be read by all creatures with an Intelligence 
score of 4 or higher. The note is a delivery request or 
similar that includes the name of an item as well as 
either specific or vague descriptions of a person or 
place. At the bottom of the letter is a price listed in 
coins or other form of payment, as well as a date or time 
depending on its urgency.
If the saddlebag is brought to the described person or 
place within the allotted time, it dispenses the magical 
item into the hand of the appropriate recipient. If the 
payment isn’t received by the bag within 1 hour of 
dispensing the magic item, the item vanishes and is lost. 
After receiving the payment for an item in this way, the 
bag’s beak reopens to dispense a reward for the courier.
Sell Magic Items.
 The saddlebag has a connection to 
the griffon’s forge on the Astral Plane. Depending on the 
magic item, you can sell a magic item to the saddlebag 
for half the cost of its base price.
Spells.
 The saddlebag has 8 charges and regains 1d6 
+ 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the 
saddlebag, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to 
cast the following spells from it: 
detect magic
 (1 charge), 
identify
 (1 charge), or 
legend lore
 (5 charges).
Additional Spells.
 At the GM’s discretion, such as 
after reaching certain milestones or completing Magic 
Courier quests, the saddlebag may offer the following 
additional spells that can be cast from it: 
blink
 (3 
charges), 
dimension door
 (4 charges), 
divination
 (4 
charges), 
etherealness
 (7 charges), 
fly
 (3 charges), 
magnificent mansion
 (7 charges), 
plane shift
 (7 charges), 
or 
secret chest
 (4 charges).
Sentience.
 The saddlebag is a sentient chaotic 
neutral bag with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, 
and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision 
out to a range of 60 feet.
The bag can speak, read, and understand Common. 
When in the presence of only creatures it trusts, the 
bag’s beak moves when it speaks. Otherwise, the bag 
communicates telepathically with its wearer. The bag 
can speak and communicate with griffons.
Personality. 
The bag’s purpose is to carry, collect, 
and deliver magic items. Different bags have different 
personalities, but they are for the most part largely 
pleasant to talk to. Their voices are bird-like and are 
filled with occasional coos and squawks, and their 
stitched eyes widen, squint, and move expressively.
If the bag’s wearer or allies fail to fulfill Magic Courier 
quests, it may stop offering its magic to them. If it does, 
their items may be lost or inaccessible within the bag, or 
potentially spat out. While the bag provides the names 
of item recipients and delivery locations, it doesn’t know 
any more information than what was provided to it by 
the astral griffon. Regardless, it does its best to help its 
wearer and allies find the specified person or location 
on the letter.
Destroying the Griffon’s Saddlebag. 
While there is 
no way to permanently destroy the saddlebag, piercing 
it with an artifact returns it to its place of origin for 
repair before it’s returned to the multiverse in a new 
location. Placing a 
Griffon’s Saddlebag
 inside the 
extradimensional space created by another 
Griffon’s 
Saddlebag
 returns both items to their place of origin 
and sends all the items stored within them to the 
griffon’s forge on the Astral Plane.
