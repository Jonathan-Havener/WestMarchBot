The cost of the casting is set by the caster who creates the spell, but is typically 1 gp per spell slot level. When the spell is cast, the royalty is magically transported to a coffer or other object designated by the creating spellcaster. This payment is made whether the caster using the spell is aware of the royalty component or not. If the caster does not have sufficient funds, the spell is not lost but it cannot be cast.\n\nThough many casters have tried to circumvent the royalty component, none have ever fully succeeded. However, it is said that a character can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check while casting a spell with a royalty component. With a successful check, the payment is taken from a random creature within 10 feet of the caster, without that creature’s knowledge."

The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5 id=\"AnimalHandling\"\u003EAnimal Handling\u003C/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5 id=\"Insight\"\u003EInsight\u003C/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYour Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5 id=\"Medicine\"\u003EMedicine\u003C/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5 id=\"Perception\"\u003EPerception\u003C/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYour Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Caside\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp id=\"finding-a-hidden-object\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFINDING A HIDDEN OBJECT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/aside\u003E\n\u003Ch5 id=\"Survival\"\u003ESurvival\u003C/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5 id=\"OtherWisdomChecks\"\u003EOther Wisdom Checks\u003C/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EGet a gut feeling about what course of action to follow\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDiscern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Ch4 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\"\u003ESpellcasting Ability\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EClerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\u003C/p\u003E"
